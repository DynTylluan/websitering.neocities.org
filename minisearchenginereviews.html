<h1>Decent Search Engines (That are not Google.)</h1>

An information monopoly (or near monopoly) is a dangerous thing. In light of that, here are some search engines to try:</p>

I used to use ScrubTheWeb a lot, but they closed last year and became a directory. If you're interested in directories, I'd suggest <a href="http://curlie.org/">Curlie</a>, a successor to DMOZ.</p>

I use <a href="http://gigablast.com/">Gigablast</a> fairly often, but usually the results are only OK. The engine has links to Google, Bing, and Yandex tho, so you can re-run the query on those engines. Gigablast does have fairly good support for advanced queries, which Google seems to have given up on.</p>

<a href="http://yandex.com/">Yandex</a> is a Russian search engine with an English version. Popular in Russia; they're actually beating Google over there.</p>

<a href="https://www.qwant.com/">Qwant</a> is a French search engine. There's an English version. It has a unique layout, but the results are kinda like Google 10-15 years ago; nice, but you'll see a ton of product listings.</p>

<a href="https://www.exalead.com/search/">Exalead's</a> still online, but the results aren't as relevant as I'd like, and once you get past the 1st page you'll see a lot of dead links.</p>

<a href="https://millie.northernlight.com/dashboardfolder.php">NorthernLight</a> re-launched a public version of their engine, but it only searches through recent business news articles; it's meant as a tech demo.</p>

<a href="https://www.mojeek.com/">Mojeek</a> is a British search engine. Not great, but not bad. Returns a lot of list articles.</p>

<a href="https://www.entireweb.com/">Entireweb</a> is actually pretty good. Not sure if they're a metasearch engine now, but the results seem unique.</p>

<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> - Use them on my phone. Usually mirrors Bing or Google. They do have a crawler tho, so some results may be unique.</p>

<a href="#">Thunderstone's Web Site Catalog</a> is cool if you just want to find sites, but it has a lot of dead links and parked domains.</p>

<a href="#">Apexoo</a> is also cool, if you need sites instead of pages. Index is a bit small; usually only returns 50 sites.</p>

<a href="https://www.yippy.com/">Yippy</a> seems to have their own index now. Has a conservative bias, but nice clustering.</p>

<a href="http://iseek.com/#/web">iSeek</a> mixes their results with Google's and provides clustering. I like their clustering a bit more that Yippie's.</p>

<a href="https://bubblehunt.com/">Bubblehunt</a> - Returns lists of sites added/checked by volunteers.</p>

<a href="https://www.alltheinternet.com/">AllTheInternet</a> - Seems to have decent, unique results. Portal-like layout. Gives you the option of searching their engine or a few other major sites/engines. Also operates <a href="https://www.searchalot.com/">SearchALot</a>, not to be confused with Search<b>.</b>alot, which is a browser hijacker.</p>

<a href="https://www.yioop.com/">Yooip</a> - Public demo of an open source search engine. 1st page looks good, but 2nd page repeats most of the 1st page's results, as does the 3rd & 4th page.</p>
