<p><b>10-31-18 <font color="red">Happy Halloween!</font></b><br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+24%3A37-39&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Luke 24:37-39</a><br><a href="http://www.weird.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Weird.com
</a> An odd little site with little content. It does have a link to an AltaVista query for the word "weird." <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961227031909/http://weird.com:80/">Here's what it looked like in 1996.</a> Had a fairly extensive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970607013211/http://www.weird.com:80/weird-list.html">links page</a> at the time. Digging a bit into the current site, there's a <a href="http://www.weird.com/~habern/">memorial page</a>. In an older version of the site, from 2001,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020806141714/http://www.weird.com:80/users.html">there was a long user list,</a> but <a href="http://www.weird.com/users.html">today</a> most of those folks have moved on. So this was a collection of homepages. 572;151
<p><b>10-30-18</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=HCSB&amp;search=Ephesians%202:8-9">Ephesians 2:8-9</a><br><a href="http://www.halloween.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Halloween.com</a> Typed this in today since the holiday's coming up, just to see what was there. Since 1994 Halloween.com's objective has been to help people find useful information about the holiday, while at the same time help those with the information find the people." According to their about page this is the <a href="http://www.halloween.com/about.php">new version of their site.</a> I wonder what it used to look like... Here it is in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961222093952/http://halloween.com:80/">1996</a>. That's as far back as the Internet archive goes, but that's still not the original site; those graphics were new for 1996, according to the copyright. Funny Line:  "The following sites are some of the more interesting offerings about vampires, one of the popular legends that people associate with Halloween.

<p><b>10-29-18</b> <a href="http://www.asovini.com/screamer/">Old-Site: Scream Heaven</a> Researching Nara Dreamland today led me to look up their sister park, Yokohama Dreamland. That led me to <a href="http://www.asovini.com/screamer/e/ydlphoto.html">this page,</a> with lots of photos of the park. It's from a theme park fan site, with lots of videos in RealPlayer or Quicktime formats. The webmaster liked Yokohama Dreamland alot, so he or she made a special photo gallery for it. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010215025805/http://www.asovini.com/screamer/">Since at least 2001.</a> You can download the videos, but the webmaster asks you to not share them online. Just provide a link. (Actually the webmaster said not to upload the vids to video sharing sites. I suppose emailing them to your friends is ok; re-hosting isn't, but that's just my non-lawyer opinion.)<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=HCSB&amp;search=Romans%2012:1">Bible Verse of the Day: Romans 12:1</a> 548;115

<p><b>10-27-18</b> <a href="http://www.sanoyas-leisure.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Sanoyas Ride Corporation</a> Last year, I featured Nara Dreamland's website. Nara Dreamkland was a 60's theme park in Japan, designed to look almost exactly like Disneyland. (Apparently Dreamland's owners were working with Disney, but things fell apart before the park was completed, so they changed the name.) It closed in 2006, & was torn down last year. This company made a bunch of their rides. <a href="http://www.sanoyas-leisure.com/profile/ssg.html">They also make ships</a> and construction equipment. Online since at least <a href="http://www.sanoyas-leisure.com/product/rc-index.html">2000.</a> Good use of frames for menus. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+4%3A8-12&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Acts 4:8-12</a> 419;94

Back then the internet hadn't really taken off like it has today, so in creating the site, Steve had made a reference point for anybody wanting to know more about the theme park.

The site went live in May 2000.

Of course, he couldn't do such a mammoth task alone. Helping him were his friends Pitson and Mac, and together they created the Alton Towers Almanac." This is the 3rd main version of the site, dating to May 2006; here's what it looked like in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001018143454/http://www.towersalmanac.com">2000</a>.

<p><b>10-25-18</b> <a href="http://pdxhistory.com/">Old-Site of the Day: PDXHistory.com</a> I was researching amusement parks today & came across this Portland history site. For some reason it has an article on <a href="http://pdxhistory.com/html/coney_island.html">Cony Island,</a> across the nation in NYC. Maybe they're just filling in some history to go along with <a href="http://pdxhistory.com/html/amusement_parks.html">Portland's old amusement parks.</a> Older amusement parks might've been light on theme, but they still had style; I especially like the looks of <a href="http://pdxhistory.com/html/council_crest.html">Council Crest</a>.

<p><b>10-24-18</b> And apparently I've absorbed Pogo's grammer. "right," not "write;" "targeted," not "Target." Oops. :)<br><a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1126.html">Old-Site of the Day: Charles M. Schulz, 'Peanuts' Creator, Dies at 77</a> Listening to some <i>Peanuts</i> music on YouTube this morning, and I read a comment that said Charles Shultz once said Charlie Brown & Peppermint Patty eventually married. While trying to find that quote, I found this. It's Shultz's obituary from the <i>New York Times</i>, archived in it's original format. Has a history of the strip, a biography of Shultz, comments from the creators of <i>For Better or Worse</i> and <i>Mutts</i>. Two errors: Adults did appear once, in a mid-50's strip where Lucy played golf, & Shults did let a few other artists draw comic books featuring the Peanuts characters for Dell. The newspaper strip was all his work tho. (Actually, if I understand things correctly, the lettering on later strips may have been done digitally by United Feature Syndicate, and the last strip was a collage of his drawings made by the syndicate with his instructions. He was too sick to actually draw it.) :(<br><A href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+49:4&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Isaiah 49:4</a> 661;119
<p><b>10-23-18</b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5zIlWSMlU8">Video: How Facebook Ad Targeting Works.</a> Suggests that Target Ads have helped people become less civil, since reactionary stories get more reactions. But Facebook's software doesn't know the stories are polarizing; it just knows they're getting shared more often. It's a computer! It has no concept of write, or wrong, of denotation or conotation, of context or motivation! All it has are numbers! <i>It only delivers what we react to.</i> To quote Pogo: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogo_(comic_strip)#%22We_have_met_the_enemy_and_he_is_us.%22">"We have met the enemy, and he is us."</a><br><img alt="Pic of Pogo, saying the above quote." src="https://websitering.neocities.org/pogo.png">(Small part of the comic; should be fair use.) 1061;155

<p><b>10-1-18</b> According to <a href="https://neocities.org/site/mistysworld">MistyWorld's</a> profile feed, Yahoo Japan is planning on closing their version of Geocities. I can't put what I feel into words. I know a lot of info will be lost; there's no way Archive.org can get everything. And what they can get will probably be hard to access. I'm sad, & a bit shocked, tho perhaps I shouldn't be. Geocities.jp was a good source for old websites, even if I didn't use it very much. I suppose I should try to save a few pages on my PC, tho i don't know if I will. Goodbye Geocities, we'll miss you.
