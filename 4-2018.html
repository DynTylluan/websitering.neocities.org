<p><b>4-25-18</b> I forgot to include a link to Flickr's new Terms yesterday. Here they are, if you want to read them for yourself: <a href="https://www.smugmug.com/about/terms-flickr">Terms.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+12%3A27&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Proverbs 12:27</a><br><a href="http://www.printer-cartridges-gbs.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Gardner Business Services</a> Found this a couple of years ago when searching for a printer cartridge which Amazon didn't have. Surprisingly they actually delivered, even tho their website looked abandoned. Online since at least 2000. <a href="http://www.printer-cartridges-gbs.com/gbs_sites.htm">At one time they offered more than printer carts,</a> but a lot of those pages seem to have stopped working in the past decade or two. 363;54</p>
<p><b>4-24-18</b> Deleted my Flickr account this morning. Yahoo sold them to another photo service, and the new service has some terms I cannot agree to:<br><br>"You retain all intellectual property rights in and to any User Content you post, upload or otherwise make available through the Services, including the copyright in and to your photos and videos. SmugMug does not claim any ownership, right, title or interest in and to your User Content.<br>
Notwithstanding the foregoing, by uploading and/or posting any User Content to the Services, you grant SmugMug a <b>perpetual</b>, nonexclusive and royalty-free right to use the User Content (and the user name that is submitted in connection with such User Content) as is reasonably necessary in order to enable SmugMug to provide the Services, including to display the User Content on the Services."<br><br>That word perpetual is key here; Flickr's old terms didn't have it. Flickr only kept your photo as long as you wanted them to keep 'em. After these terms come into effect they can keep your pictures forever and do almost anything with them, as long as the use relates to their service. It's not stealing per se, since it's something users have to agree to. It is, however, asking too much for this user. 633;98</p>
<p><b>4-23-18</b> <a href="minisearchenginereviews.html">Small reviews of a few decent search engines, excluding Google & Bing.</a> Wrote these up for a forum posting; thought they mighe be useful here too.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15%3A1-4&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Gateway John 15:1-4</a><br><a href="http://www.rarebreeds.co.nz/index.html">Old-Site of the Day: Rare Breeds Homepage</a> A website about rare breeds of livestock from New Zealand.

<p><b>4-21-18</b> <a href="http://www.nuon-dome.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Nuon-Dome</a> The Nuon was am extra chip manufacturers could add to DVD players to make them full-fledged gaming machines. Not a bad idea, but it was stopmed into the ground by the more powerful PS2. This fan site has kept up with it since 200, when the Nuon was new. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011202184013/http://www.nuon-dome.com/">Heres'a what the site looked like in 2001, about a year after it opened.</a><br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+8:5&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Ecclesiates 8:5</a> 360;66</p>

Great! All you need is an Atari ST, TT, or Falcon computer & a discontinued device made by the guy behind this site! He was planning to make a PC version, but gave up when Atari died. A few games were completed with it, and they're listed on this site. Also links to Dilbert comic strips.<br><a href="https://zsplanet.neocities.org/bloomwebsearch/index.html">Search Service of the Day: Bloom Websearch</a> <a href="https://zsplanet.neocities.org/">ZSplanet</a> asked me to link to this. It's a Google Custom Search Engine set up to look through DMOZTools, a mirror of the defunct web directory.

It's not even parked; it's just gone. All-Reviews.com was the Old-Site of the Day for 8-22-17. It had been online since the late 90's & offered a large collection of user-submitted reviews for various media. The Wayback Machine last crawled it late last year, but I think it All-Reviews was still running a few weeks ago. Sad, so much info gone. Let's hope the archive stays up. 471;147</p>
<p><b>4-9-18</b> <a href="http://www.lostparks.com/index.html">Old-Site of the Day: Florida's Lost Tourist Attractions</a> I'd completely forgotten about this site till this weekend when I looked up <a href="http://www.lostparks.com/piratesw.html">Pirate's World</a>.
