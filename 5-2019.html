<p><b>5-11-19</b> <a href="http://www.kotterink.com/expression/">Old-Site of the Day: Expression 3D Toolkit</a> "Expression is a free Object Oriented 3D toolkit. It is written in C++/STL. It has support for interactive 3D graphics using OpenGL and non-interactive sphere tracing. Expression comes with a set of tools a sphere tracer and an interactive 'World editor'. The tool kit started as a collection of program I wrote just for the full[sic] of it. During the mounths of development I factored more and more code out and created a few libraries. The tool kit is not completed yet, it will probably always remain 'under construction'. However the low level libraries (Base, Geo) are quite fundamental and will not change a lot." Looks like it hasn't been updated since 2003, but it's still online if you want to play around with it.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=Ephesians%204:32">Bible Verse of the Day: Ephesians 4:32</a>
