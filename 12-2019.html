<h1>December 2019</h1>

<p><b>12-9-19</b> Well, I missed Pearl Harbor day & my site's birth day, & I've not got any more work done on the old updates. :/ Still, I have to announce this: The Internet Archive Wayback Machine no longer respects robots.txt exclusions. That means more old websites are avaliable for viewing, & it also means you can't permanently delete your site. If it's already archived, it's there! And fior me that's fine; I can now look up old Google searches & I can crawl through Infoseek's directory again, & the ominous OATH corporation can't delete DMOZ's archive, accidentally or otherwise. 

<p><b>12-10-19</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+18%3A15-16&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Deuteronomy 18:15-16</a><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011210183843/http://www.yahoo.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Yahoo.com, on this day in 2001.</a> I haven't spent much time exploring Yahoo in the Wayback machine; their director y was blocked by a Robots.txt file in 1999 or so. Since the Internet Archive lifted that restriction I though this would be a good time to explore.

<p><b>12-16-19</b> Working up a privacy policy. <a href="privacy.html">Here's what I have.</a> Tell me what you think.

<p><b>12-17-19</b> Added back all the old updates, including the bits I deleted. This also means I've added back some grammer & spelling errors, but that's ok; the informastion is  more important than the presentation. :)

<p><b>12-18-19</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+2%3A25-35&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Luke 2:25-35</a> I always thought this was a cool story, but it gets overlooked when folks talk about Jesus' birth. Why? It's cool!

<p><b>12-27-19</b> <a href="http://www.classicbookshelf.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Classic Book Shelf</a> A site with old, public domain books. Books are organized by <a href="http://www.classicbookshelf.com/library/">author,</a> or you can run a search for titles.  It also has <a href="http://www.classicbookshelf.com/search.htm">this neat list of old search engines.</a> Online since at least 2000, according to the copyright.
