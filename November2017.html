This is a tribute site. From the about page: "In 2003, I started looking around the net for information or sites about my favorite theme park Opryland. The more I looked around the more disheartened I became. There wasn't really anything about the park on the web. It was like it had never existed.  Opryland is where I had so many fond memories, my summers were spent there (thanks to my season pass) from around 1984 until the park closed in 1997.  I couldn't let a very happy part of my past go quietly into the void of nothingness. So Thrillhunter was born." Here's what ThrillHunter looked like in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030823152914/http://www.thrillhunter.com/">2003.</a> 543;128</p>

<p><b>11-15-17</b> Clarification: A few months ago DMOZ's editors set up was a static landing page with links to their fourms and DMOZTools, a mirror. There was no search engine, no way to volunteer, no way to suggest sites, suggest changes, or edit. Yesterday they launched the full version of the directory; you should be able to do all those things now.
