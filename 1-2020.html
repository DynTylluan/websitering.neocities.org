<p><b>1-6-20</b> This site passed 94k unique views this weekend! Thank you!<br><a href="https://websitering.neocities.org/DMOZDefence2.txt">DMOZ Defence</a> I saw a link to an article on Resource-Zone a few years ago. It bugged me, so I wrote a counter arguement.  Never posted it. I said I'd write more articles, so here you go, my response to  Zvelo.com's article on DMOZ's demise.

I find this ove a bit easier to use than the main site, tho I don't like everything this site links to. While the database is from 2002, the website didn't have a public version till at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061114132027/http://sniff.numachi.com/">2006</a>. Before then it was just a mostly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040606030750/http://sniff.numachi.com/">empty landing page</a> with the site's name, or an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010504081333/http://sniff.numachi.com/">Apache configuration page</a>.
