<p><b>2-27-19</b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+3%3A17-19&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: 1 John 3:17-19</a><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961221001437/http://www.byte.com/art/9403/sec5/art1.htm">Old-Site of the Day: Building The Data Highway</a> "Many of the technologies and players needed to construct the information infrastructure are already in place. But the precise definition of the data highway is in the eye of the beholder. Who builds it could dramatically affect how it works--and how it's used." A 1994 article about the internet.
<p><b>2-26-19</b> "Updsating!?" Good grief; when will I learn to spell?<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A5-10&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: 1 John 4:5-10</a><br><a href="http://www.search-beat.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Search-Beat.com</a> Another web directory from the late 90's. Has separate sections fore news & site listings. Doesn't have its own search engine; relies on Google for searching. Since at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981111190151/http://www.search-beat.com/">1998</a>. Could also be a search service of the day.
<p><b>2-25-19</b> Hello again, & sorry for not updsating last week. Some weeks are too busy. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=Matthew%2022:37-39">Bible Verse of the Day: Matthew 22:37-29</a><br><a href="http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/filmnotes/cinerama2.html">Old-Site of the Day: FilmNotes</a> A fairly nice article chronicaling the history of Cinerama, from 1995, on a university website. Originaly from a site called Film Notes, now offline.
<p><b>2-16-19</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+22%3A10-18&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: Acts 22:10-18</a><br><a href="http://www.christiansunite.com/">Old-Site of the Day: ChristiansUnite.com</a> A web portal with a Christian focus. Contains a Google-based article serach engine, a directory of Christian web sites, a news service which needs to be updated, hosts blogs, etc. Started in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991013090310/http://www.christiansunite.com/">1999</a> as a directory.</a> Here's an article on <a href="http://articles.ochristian.com/article10534.shtml">baptism</a>. I agree with most of the author's points, tho saying baptism is merely a confession of faith would contradict what Ananias said to Paul. It is better to say that belief leads to salvation, & that remission of sins happens at the act. After all faith is not mere belief; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A14-26&amp;version=NKJV">it's belief which leads to action.</a> 
<p><b>2-14-19</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=John%2013:34-35">Bible Verse of the Day: John 13:34-35</a>
<p><b>2-13-19</b> Hmmmm... Seems I've gotten my dates mixed up & have been running a day ahead. No matter. Today's the 13th; the last post should read 2-12, then 2-11, & so on till whenever I made the mistake. Sorry about that.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A17&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: John 3:17</a><br><a href="http://www.metnews.com/">Old-Site of the Day: MetNews.com</a> I said I'd feature this, so here it is! MetNews is a Los Angeles newspaper, & they have the oldest-looking site of any opperating newspaper I've seen. But you know what? It's simple, fast loading, & it works.  Focuses on legal news.
<p><b>2-13-19</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13%3A+8-12&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: 1 Corinthians 13:8-12</a><br><a href="http://www.metnews.com/reminiscing.htm">Old-Site of the Day: Reminiscing</a> Hidded on a news company's server, I founds this site about earlt TV shows, Los Angelas, & food. some of the articles date to 2003, & I doubt anyone would even try such an odd framing set up after that. Looks like the newest articles are from 2010 & the oldest ones are from 2002. The news site itself is rather old, but I'll leave it for another day.

<p><b>2-6-19</b> Sorry for not updating at all yesterday; I was <i>very</i> busy. <br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=Proverbs%2021:21">Bible Verse of the Day: Proverbs 21:21</a><br><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18204943/ultraviolet-locker-shutdown-date">Goodbye, UltraViolet</a>The movie streaming service is shutting down in July. Never tried it; thought it was a download service. A download sounds more useful.<br><a href="http://arbok.faithweb.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Venom</a> Not about the Spiderman character; about Ekans & Arbok from Pokemon. Has a pic of a cobra edited to look like a real Arbok. Fairly standard fansite stuff: an episode guide noting which episodes are "snakey", scans of the manga, fanfics, etc.

<p><b>2-2-19</b> Oops... wrote the wrong year on my last post. Fixed it now. Well, it's Febuary, so happy Febuary. And My site has had over 64,000 unique views.
