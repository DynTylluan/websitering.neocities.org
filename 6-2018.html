<p><b>6-30-18</b> <a href="http://americankaiju.kaijuphile.com/">Old-Site of the Day: American Kaiju: The Website</a> Dating to 2004, this site covers monster movies. Last updated in 2010.  363;92</p>

<p><b>6-28-18</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=HCSB&amp;search=2%20Peter%203:9">Bible Verse of the Day: 2 Peter 3:9</a><br><a href="http://www.csoon.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Coming Soon Magazine</a> Now here's something exciting. While searching for a Good site on a canceled Pac-Man game from the mid-90's, I stumbled onto this old online gaming magazine, started in 1994. 304;62</p>

<p><b>6-26-18</b> Well, here's another closed site: <a href="http://www.kidsclick.org/">KidsClick.org</a> was a decent directory of kid-friendly websites organized by age & subject. Closed earlier this year. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000601000000*/http://www.kidsclick.org/">Old-Site of the Day: KidsClick in 2000</a> Dig that funky green mascot. :)<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+18%3A15-17&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Luke 18:15-17</a> 485;122</p>
<p><b>6-25-18</b> <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/empire/erbcomic/colintro.html">Old-Site of the Day: Edgar Rice Burroughs Fantasy Collectibles Shop</a> Ran a search for Dell Comics today, & Gigablast spit out this. Not what I was looking for, but interesting none-the-less. It's an online museum of sorts for Edgar Rice Burroughs (<i>Tarzan, John Carter of Mars.</i>) Since 1996, according to the copyright. 346;97</p>

<p><b>6-22-18</b> Wrote this awhile back, & I'm a bit sheepish about posting it. It's a parody of the 1st episode of Pokemon. Some of it may only make sense if you've seen the show & researched the franchise's history, or it may just be silly enough to be fun on its own. I don't know. Anyways, here it is: <a href="https://websitering.neocities.org/pkmn.txt">Pokemon Spoof.</a> 540;93</p><p><b>6-21-18</b> 230;86</p><p><b>6-20-18</b> 393;80</p><p><b>6-19-18</b> 232;57</p><p><b>6-18-18</b> 406;77</p>

<p><b>6-16-18</b> Wasn't planning on updating today, but I just found out <a href="http://blog.wikispaces.com/">Wikispaces is closing.</a> That's significant. Wkikspaces is aa approx. 13 year old Wikihosting service used by educators & businesses alike. Basicaly, it'll cost too much to "bring the [site's] infrastructure and code in line with modern standards" so they decided to close. Wonder if this has to do with Europe's new law... <a href="https://websitering.neocities.org/wikispaces.txt">Archived version of the closure announcement, for historical/educational purposes.</a> 430;80</a>

<p><b>6-12-18</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+19%3A1-5&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Psalm 19:1-5</a> And today I release my website into the public domain. You can freely copy, modify, mirror, re-host, any content I created & posted here. A link back might be nice but isn't necessaary. Some things, obviously, I didn't create; those wouldn't be in the public domain.  They were used for educational purposes. That's legal in the U.S., under the fair-use doctrine. In a different, non-educational context, or in a different country, they might be illegal to host. A few other things, like link-to buttons from other sites, would be under licensed. Those, also, wouldn't be in the public domain; they're still under whatever license the copyright holder provided. 450;175</p>

Here's what appears to be a 1997 page reviewing the Spaceworld Pokemon Proto, which was just found and released by a fan group a few days ago. <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ja&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.geocities.jp%2Fpcakatsuki%2Fpokemonlab%2Fprepm2.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url">Here's the page translated.</a> 554;105</p>

SRB2 is closely inspired by the original Sonic games from the Sega Genesis, and attempts to recreate the design in 3D. While SRB2 isn't fully completed, it already features tons of levels, enemies, speed, and quite a lot of the fun that the original Sonic games provided." The project turned 20 years old this year. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010330054515/https://www.srb2.org/">Here's what the site looked like when it first opened in 2001.</a> 495;118</p>
<p><b>6-8-18</b> <a href="http://www.platypuscomix.net/">Old-Site of the Day: PlatypusComix.net</a> Platypus Comix started as a Geocities site. The author, Peter Paltridge, would post comix he made & articles about his interests. Still updated about once a month; his most recent <a href="http://www.platypuscomix.net/otherpeople/pointrichmond.html">article</a> has a link to an ealry demo for Pokemon Silver and Gold. (Cue <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yynOx8wHWAc">Burl Ives.</a>) Most of the articles on the site still look like they were thrown together on a text-editor in the early 2000's.<br> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+24:35&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Genesis 24:35</a> 358;83</p>
