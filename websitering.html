  <h1>Web-Site-Ring: Create one without scripting</h1>

  <p>In 2015 Neocities introduced Surf Mode, an attempt to create a modern alternative to Web-Site-Rings using tags. The idea sounds good, but it has  problems.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Users tag sites based on their interest; not based on site topic.  The sites in question may have nothing to do with the tagged topics.</li>
  <li>Web-Site-Rings are a club-Like experience.  A person may want to join a ring based on personal relations with the ring's owner or other members.  A tagging system, where everyone interested in a topic is automatically grouped, cannot replicate this.</li>
  <li>A ring's owner can enforce a degree of quality controll, by refusing to admit or removing outdated, abandoned, or poorly made sites. An automatic tagging system elimates this.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If someone wanted to, he could set up a WebRing at WebRings.org, but they require intrusive ads, and they'll only allow one to list a few sites for free.</p>
  
  <p>As such, we need a way to create a web-site-ring without relying on NeoCities Surf Mode, or an out-side, non-free service.
  I think I've figured it out:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Each Site in the ring has a number, assigned by the ring owner</li>
  <li>The ring owner creates two pages for each site: <tt>[siteNumber]_Previous.html</tt> and <tt>[siteNumber]_Next.html</tt></li>
  <li>These pages are set up to redirect a visitor to the previous and next sites on the ring.</li>
  <li>If a site goes off-line, the ring's owner simply changes two files, the ones before and after the site.</li>
  </ol>
