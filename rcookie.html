<p>Problem: "People get married because they love eachother" is an over simplification; a child's view of mariage. "People get married to start a family" is a more correct, tho still child-appropriate, answer. To explain this would require the parent to define the different types of love, which might not be appropriate for a 3-4 year old.

<p>Long ago someone asked why many clergy approved of homosexuality. Have you read 2nd Timothy? "3 For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, 4 and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths." - 2 Timothy 4:3-4 Now there's little context in the letter itself; we must rely on the rest of the Bible to provide context, to determine what sound doctrine is. What does the Bible say about sexual sin? About marriage? What examples does it give of each?
