<p><b>9-29-18</b> Looking at Jabootu.com's archive, I think he moved in 2007 or 2008; there's a counter on his front page which stopped in 2007. (Actually, it started counting backwards, if you want to be exact.)<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=HCSB&amp;search=John%203:20-21">Bible Verse of the Day: John 3:20-21</a><br><a href="http://www.locusmag.com/2003/Reviews/10_Person_Vance.html">Old-Site of the Day: Locus Online, <i>Dragon Masters</i> Review from 2003</a> Jack Vance wrote the short novel <i>Dragon Masters</i> in 1962; this is a review of a rerelease in 2003. Read the book a few months ago; it's not bad. 562;122</p>

<p><b>9-27-18</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A30-33&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Matthew 6:30-33</a><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981201183859/http://www.jabootu.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Jabootu Bad Movie Dimension, in 1998</a> A late 90's B-Movie site. This version's been offline for a couple of years, but the author started a <a href="http://jabootu.net/">new version.</a> Long, detailed reviews. Part of the <a href="http://b-masters.com/about/">B-Masters' Cabal</a>, along with StompTokyo & BadMovies.org, both of which have already been featured. Here's the last archive of Jabootu's old site, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021070133/http://www.jabootu.com/">2016.</a> He'd actually moved the site a few years before then, tho I'm not sure exactly when. 642;202</p>
<p><b>9-26-18</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=HCSB&amp;search=Hebrews%2010:30-31">Bible Verse of the Day: Hebrews 10:30-31</a><br><a href="https://www.seanet.com/~bradford/blue_green_screen_visual_effects_1.html">Old-Site of the Day: The Blue/Green Screen Page</a> A page about chromakey, touting consumer-level FX tech. Written in 1995, updated since then to reflect changing terminology. Looks like the last major revision was about 10 years ago. 436;101</p>
<p><b>9-25-18</b> Sorry for not updating last week. What can I say? Sometime's life's busy.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+16%3A14-20&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Mark 16:14-20</a><br><a href="https://wichm.home.xs4all.nl/filmsize.html">Old-Site of the Day 100 Years of Film Sizes.</a> Folks who shoot cell-phone video vertically get a lot of flack, but I remember reading of one vertically oriented film format from the 50's. While trying to find it again, I found this site. Doesn't have the format I was looking for, but it does have a lot of other obscure formats, like 28mm, or glass-disk formats. Online since '96; most recently updated this year.</p> 568;119

Started as an article in 1997. He's decided to limit it to works made before 2016, since Wikipedia is a good-enough source, & since he can't keep this up forever.

<p><b>9-8-18</b> <a href="http://www3.northern.edu/wild/">Old-Site of the Day: Larry Wild, Assistant Professor of Theatre, Emeritus</a> College propfessors tend to have old-style websites. They're smart enough to write HTML on their own, so they use few scripts/templates. I found this one while looking up how to build <a href="http://www3.northern.edu/wild/th241/sc92.htm">flats.</a> Wild's site has a ton of <a href="http://www3.northern.edu/wild/th241/th241.htm">resources</a> for folks trying to put together a theater production, with an emphasis on <a href="http://www3.northern.edu/wild/litedes/ldw11.htm">lighting</a>. Since 1996, according to the copyright.
