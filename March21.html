<h1>Updates March 2021</h1>

<p><b>3-31-21</b> Well, it's the last day of the month. Fancy that. Time marches ever forward, & there's not a thing I can do to stop it...<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053:5-6&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: Isaiah 53:5-6</a><br><a href="http://www.deltasoft.com/opendos.htm">Old-Site of the Day: Open DOS Unofficial Home Page</a> It's 1997. Microsoft has locked out most other OS makers from the market. The rights to DR-DOS, Digital Research's upgraded, MS-DOS compatible version of CP/M-86 have passed through several different hands. Finally the last owner, Caldera, has decided to call it quits, & they anounce that they're going to release the OS as an open source program, OpenDOS. This page is a fan site for the OS, made just after the announcement, but before the OS was actually open-sourced. I'm not sure if it ever was; sometimes things don't work out the way they're planned. 

<p><b>3-30-21</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053:3-4&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: Isaiah 53:3-4</a><br><a href="http://hponline.sourceforge.net/">Old-Site of the Day: Hot Potatoh Online</a> This was some sort of game...but the site's broken. First appears in the Wayback Machine in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050304120758/http://hponline.sourceforge.net/">2005.</a> Here's the description from then: "Hot Potato Online is a fast paced arena sport game where players try to explode the opposition using a short-fused potato bomb.  Think dodgeball with a grenade" Sounds like fun. Looks like you can still download it from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hponline/files/Hot Potato Online/Version 1.0.0/HotPotatoOnlineInstaller-v1.0.0.exe/download?use_mirror=master&amp;download=">Sourceforge</a>. I haven't tried the program tho, so download/run at your own risk.

<p><b>3-29-21</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5%3A20-21&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: 2 Corinthians 5:20-21</a><br><a href="https://www.angelfire.com/ca/shadowcraft/">Old-Site of the Day: The Official Shadowcraft Homepage</a> "Shadowcraft was formed sometime in 1995 with the hope of facilitating the programming and distribution of our releases. Today, almost 2 years later we are still memberless, but that doesn't stop us from releasing some darn good utilities. Enjoy the site," A collection of freeware utilities. The author seemes to have hate registering programs; these were things he made for his own use, & offered to others so they could use them.

<p><b>3-27-21</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2062:7&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: Psalm 62:7</a><br><a href="http://www.muffshardware.com/">Old-Site of the Day: 
Muff's Restoration Hardware Homepage</a> Sells antique hardware, online since at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010518013942/http://www.muffshardware.com/">2001.</a>

<p><b>3-25-21</b> Just found out yesterday that SMBHQ is gone. The venerable, yet rather disorganized old Mario site wasn't generating enogh traffic, so <a href="http://www.vgf.com/viewtopic.php?p=1691789#p1691789">the guy who owned the domain name decided not to renew it.</a> Sad, in a way. That was one of my favorite sites in highschool, & it was neat that it was still online after 20 years.

<p>3-23-21</b> My, this month is moving fast...<br><a href="http://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/index.html">Old-Site of the Day: BBCBASIC.co.uk/index.html</a> Online since at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041102092143/http://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/index.html">2004</a>, this site is a collection of resources for a British variant of the popular programming language. Weirdly, the server delivers <a href="http://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcbasic.html">a different page</a> if you type in the domain name without also typing ".index.html"

<p><b>3-20-21</b> Today is the first official day of Spring, so I looked up Spring in the Bible. This appears to be the first reference to the season: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Samuel+11%3A1-5&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: 2 Samuel 11:1-5</a> The start of King David's downfall.

<p><b>3-19-21</b> <a href="http://www.wingnuttoons.com/">Old-Site of the Day: WingnutToons.com</a> 'Original Website "Wingnuttoons.com" was first uploaded on August 22, 1997' About TV cartoons from the 60's, 70's, & 80's.

<p><b>3-17-21</b> <a href="http://www.oldqslcards.com/">Old-Site of the Day: OldQSLCards.com</a> An archive of cards sent by ham radio opperators to ham radio opperators. "The Purpose of this Website is to SAVE as many Old QSL Cards as possible and
to get them back into the HANDS of the People they mean the MOST to.
" Since 2004, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100820220643/http://www.oldqslcards.com/">Wayback Machine only goes back to 2010</a>.

<p><b>3-16-21</b> Yes, I'm still here. I just took a break for a few weeks. I put <a href="pkmn/menu.html">My Pokemon page</a> back up, with an expanded ersion of the <a href="https://websitering.neocities.org/pkmn/controvercy.htm">Conrovercy page</a>. In truth, that stuff still makes me nervous, so I took it off line a few weeks ago, with plans to either delete it or improve it. I still don't think it's perfect, but I already backed up everything in the Wayback Machine, so I figured I migt as well put it back here, so i could maintain some control over it's content.<br>So...with that heavy stuff out of the way...How about an Old-Site of the Day? <a href="http://www.kobol.com/">Kobol.com</a> Not about the programming language; that's spelt with a "C." This is about the originaal <i>Battle Star Galactica</i>, A fairlf fun TV show which didn't last long enough. Oline since '97, this site has pictures of sets, collecting info, & <a href="http://www.kobol.com/archives/BG-FAQ.html#G4">a long FAQ</a> about the series. (That's how I found the site; the FAQ was linked to on Wikipedia.)<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A9-14&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: Colossians 3:9-14</a>
