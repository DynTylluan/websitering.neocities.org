Somehow the official site's still up. Are they still being sold? 371;50</p>
<p><b>5-30-18</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+56%3A4&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Psalm 56:4</a><br><a href="http://www.flyingdreams.org/">Old-Site of the Day: FlyingDreams.org</a> A homepage with a cool name, since 1996. Focuses on baby-boomer nostalgia. Good info on older TV shows, especially Lassie.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne4QGP3_n5k">AtariBox Meets its Goal</a> Within the 1st hour. (They renamed it recently; it's now the Atari VCS. I'm going to keep calling it the AtariBox to avoid confusion with the original <a href="http://atariage.com/2600/index.php">Atari VCS,</a> from 1977.)<br>Have I mentioned this yet? <a href="https://dotcomboom.neocities.org/">dotcomboom</a> has an <a href="https://dotcomboom.neocities.org/moz/">archive of Mozilla images,</a> including both the versions which graced Mozilla's homepage in the 90's & the ones DMOZ used till the directory closed last year.

<p><b>5-29-18</b> <a href="http://www.shadowsanctum.net/">Old-Site of the Day: Shadow Sanctum</a> Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knooooows!

This is an informational site, not a breeder. Focuses on Chow Chows, an ancient breed of blue-tounged dogs from China, but some of the info should apply to other breeds as well. Since 2001, last updated in 2014, going by the copyright. 791;139</p>

They made calculators & Pong clones before expanding into proper game consoles & computers. The APF Imagination Machine was their console/computer hybrid. It started as a game system, but you could buy a docking station to turn it into a proper computer. Never very popular, APF couldn't provide a lot of software, the system was discontinued in '83 or '84. This is a fan site, which traces the system's history. 530;99</p>
<p><b>5-16-18</b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFtuEQQ2mjk">Here's an interesting video</a> about Crash Bandicoot.

This site's been up since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000925102742/http://www.vintagecalculators.com/">2000.</a> Still looks about the same. And why shouldn't it? It's a workable layout which provides the needed information with a minimum of fuss or bloat. In short: don't fix what works. 533;96</p>
<p><b>5-14-18</b> Europe's enacting <a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/gdpr-faqs.html">new privacy laws</a> which sound like a doozy. I agree that companies should keep info safe, but I'm sure this will have a chilling effect on hobbiest websites. <a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/gdpr-faqs.html">Just read the responses to this blog.</a><br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+10%3A20&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Ecclesiastes 10:20</a> 1123; 153 Wow...

He links to a few pages in the WayBack Machine. I like ShareYourWorld's layout a bit more than EarthNoise's. Earth Noise did have a video <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000817064852/http://earthnoise.com:80/chan_guide/">directory</a>; they called it a channel guide. Archive.org seems to have crawled EarthNoise a bit more deeply than ShareYourWorld, which is nice. There's a great <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000816215449/http://www.earthnoise.com/help/contents.pl#">Help Page</a> which'll tell you what it took to stream vids in the late 90's. 603;157</p>

Started in 1997, but doesn't appear to have been avaliable to the public till 2000. Went offline in 2001. The site allowed users to sell their photos & videos, & it took a portion of the sales to cover hosting costs. <a href="http://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/ShareYourWorld-and-Make-Money-from-Your-Home-Videos-62098.aspx">Here's a contemporary article about it.</a> Mentions other early video hosts. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnf4RgehMFo">Here's a news video on YouTube about it.</a> I like the layout & color scheme. It has a directory of videos and photos by topic; I wsih YouTube, Viemo, or DailyMotion had someything like that.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+1%3A10&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Ecclesiates 1:10</a></p>

I haven't done much research yet, but the site itself seems to be fairly old, with reviews dating back to the mid-90's. 499;97</p>

<p><b>5-5-18</b> This seems important: <a href="https://danluu.com/web-bloat/">Web-Bloat</a><br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+4%3A7-8&amp;version=HCSB">1 Timothy 4:7-8</a><br><a href="http://gfabasic.net/">Old-Site of the Day: GFABasic.net</a> This site's only been archived by the WayBackMachine twice: once in 2001, again in 2017. I's about aBASIC interperator/compiler for Atari's later computers. There's also an Amiga version, so Commodore fans don't have to feel left out. 447;109</p>

<p><b>5-3-18</b> <a href="http://www.aycyas.com/">Old-Site of the Day: And You Call Yourself A Scientist!</a> I planned to feature this site a few months ago, but all I could find was a new version. The webmaster's stopped updating this version, & is moving everything to a blog. This is the old version. Provides "a mad scientist's views on other mad scientists. And mad doctors, monsters, murderers, psychopaths, ghosts, freaks, weirdos and things that go bump all hours of the night and day." (It's a movie review site.)
