<h1>Updates October 2017</h1>

<p><b>10-31-17</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel+28&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day 1st Samuel 28</a> A witch, a ghost, and a prediction of doom? In the Bible? Yes...That's why I chose it for today. Happy Halloween Folks!<br><a href="http://www.darkshadowsfestival.com/">Old-Site of the Day: DarkShadowsFestival.com</a> Dark Shadows was a late 60's early 70's soap opera on U.S. TV. Instead of focusing on standard melodramatic fare, the producer Dan Curtis decided to focus on gothic horror. The Collisn family deals with witches, ghosts, and vampires, and the like on a regular basis. This fan site first appears in the Wayback Machine in 2000, and its latest news article is from last year, the 50th anniversiary of the series. 813; 114</p>
<p><b>10-30-17</b> <a href="http://www.firststarsoftware.com/">Old-Site of the Day: FirstStarSoftware.com</a> First Star Software created the classic computer game Boulder Dash the 80's. Still around today, their website hasn't changed much since I was in highschool. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010210193720/http://www.firststarsoftware.com/">Here it is in 2001.</a><br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+24%3A35-43&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Luke 24:35-43</a> 275;34</p>
<p><b>10-29-17</b> Sorry, no update today! 433;58</p>
<p><b>10-28-17</b> <a href="http://www.ozyr.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Ozyr.com</a> Info on often over-looked video game systems, like the Vectrex, Atari 5200, and the Astrocade. Since 1993. Looks like it's still being maintained.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+26%3A10&amp;version=HCSB">Bible verse of the Day: Job 26:10</a></p>
<p><b>10-27-17</b> <a href="http://www.madrigaldesign.it/creativemu/">Old-Site of the Day: The CreatiVision Emulation Central</a> The Creativision was an early 80's videogame system/computer made by V-Tech. Never heard much about it other than the name, and the fact that the two controllers could be placed next to each other to make a keyboard. While browsing AtariAge I stumbled on a link to a site with more CreatiVision info than I ever thought I'd see! Has a history of the system, game downloads, emulators, and contemporary articles about the system. There's even a forum! (Are there that many CreatiVision fans?) Started in 2001.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+51%3A10&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Psalm 51:10</a><br><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/07/ars-reader-so-a-guy-walks-into-my-shop-with-an-infinium-phantom-console/">An Infinium Labs Phantom Proto may have been found.</a> Infinium labs proposed a download/streaming only video game system back in the early 2000s. They spent years trying to bring it to market, but they ran out of money before it could be released. <a href="http://www.videogameconsolelibrary.com/pg00-phantom.htm#page=reviews">Here's a good history of the system.</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/DpNK9Iym2gM">And here's an old promo video.</a></p>

Cody's Homepage</a> A prototypical mini-blog. The author posted pictures and paragraphs about his interests on a variety of subjects. No dates, but before 2000. Images were hosted at other sites, most of which are gone. Only two pictures, a photo of his girlfriend and an Atari Jaguar cats-eye gif, remain. 280;60</p>

Bosconian is one of my favorite classic games, and it's sorely overlooked. Playing as a space ship you fly around a scrolling play field trying to destroy several space stations. Asteroids, mines, and squadrons of enemy fighters get in your way. It was probably too technically challanging to bring this to the 2600 in '81; this version may use an extra processor in the cart. 739;134</p>
