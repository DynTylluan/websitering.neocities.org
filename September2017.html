<h1>Updates September 2017</h1>

<p><b>9-30-17</b> Wow...It's the last day of the month; I didn't realize October was so close.<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961022174839/http://www.atlanta.olympic.org:80/">Old-Site of the Day: Official 1996 Olympic Web Site</a> I should probably save this till the Olympics are going again, but I'm not. :) This site uses server-side image maps, which the Internet Archive didn't archive. You can still click on the regular text links. The 1996 Olympics were in Atlanta, Georgia, in the U.S., and they had a funny blue blob as their mascot. <a href="http://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/izzy-memorabilia-actually-created/">He was named Izzy.</a> He had his own <a href="https://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.4/articles/kowalskizzy1.4.html">TV special</a> too, but it only aired once or twice; it's never been released online or on home video, officially or unofficially.<br><a href="http://www.atarihq.com/mainsite/">Just found out AtariHQ is offline.</a> Used to be a good Atari site, but it's kinda been running on fumes for the past decade. They still hosted a lot of fun content, including TSR's Nes Archive. That's still up, <a href="http://www.atarihq.com/tsr/">here,</a> but I don't know how long it'll last.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+4%3A29&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Deuteronomy 4:29</a></p>

<p><b>9-28-17</b> <a href="http://labyrnth.tripod.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Labyrinth: The Unofficial Home Page</a> A fansite for the Jim Henson Fantasy film starring David Bowie. Fairly standard collection of information; the kind of things you'd see on Wikipedia today, tho this site also has fan works.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+1%3A5-11&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: 1 Timothy 1:5-11</a> 351;105</p>

Ilinked to one on Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion process. Also has articles on dinosaurs, UFO's, Cryptids, wonders of the world, a scetion on real science experiments, etc. Started in '96. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000511050842/http://www.unmuseum.org:80/">Here's what may be the earliest archived version, from 2000.</a><br>18,500 unique views since this site launched! Thank you! 351;105</p>
<p><b>9-26-17</b> A few months ago, Atari announced that they were planning to release a new video game system named the Atari Box. (No; it wasn't April 1.) I signed up for their email list and have been waiting for more info since then. Got an email today. The Atari Box will be based around an AMD processor and will run Linux. Will be an open system instead of a closed system like most game systems. Will launch on Indigogo for 250-300 dollars this fall. <a href="http://mailchi.mp/ataribox/first-look-ataribox-design-36241?e=806f84ef27">Here's the announcement.</a> I've been an Atari fan since I was 6 or 7, so this interests me. We'll see how it goes. 412;70</p>
<p><b>9-25-17</b> <a href="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/">Old-Site of the Day: DragonsFoot.Org</a>  A fan site for TRS's RPG Dungeons and Dragons. Started in 1999. I don't know much about D&D, but I do like this site's<a href="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/search/index.shtml">search engine.</a> <br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+4:23&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Matthew 4:23</a> 397;68</p>

<p><b>9-23-17</b> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981202200917/http://toysrgus.com:80/">Old-Site of the Day: The Star Wars Collerctors Archive</a> A site cataloging Star Wars toys. Had the domain name ToysR<b>G</b>us for <i>years.</i> Toys 'R Us did <i>not</i> like that that, and, after years of leagle back-and forth, the webmaster gave up the domain name. Sadly, I don't remember the new domain name.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+16%3A28&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Dat: Proverbs 16:28</a> 575;95</p>

<p><b>9-21-17</b> Thanks for over 18k views!</br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961228165316/http://www.toysrus.com:80/">Old-Site of the Day: ToysRUs.com, in 1996.</a> Toys R Us, the U.S. chain of big box toy stores, filed for chapter 11 this week, so here's the earliest archived version of their website. Nice use of image maps. 90's websites are stereotyped as collections of blinking GIFs, but those were mostly amature sites set up on ISPs' free/included webspace. There were good-looking, easily navigatable, creative sites, even in '96. (And surprisingly, it looks like I spelled navigatable correctly in one try. Hooray!)<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+8%3A22-25&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Luke 8:22-25</a><br><a href="http://goodgopher.com/">Search-Service of the Day: GoodGopher.com</a> A search engine "for independent news." Created by a website owner who thought Google was censoring his site. Breaks sites down into categories which users can search individually. Categories include "independent media, maintsream media, academia, and products." Users can "like" a site; liked sites are given a boost. Users can also flag a site for manual review. Started in 2015. Not my favorite engine; I'd prefer something less focused on the news, but it exists, so here ya go! 461;89</p>
<p><b>9-20-17</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+2%3A9-11&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Hebrews 2:9-11</a><br><a href="http://www.blackviper.com/2001/12/28/xbox-rant/">Old-Site of the Day: BlackViper.com</a> A computer guide site with a cool domain name. Copyright from 1999-Today. I linked to an article about the Xbox; the author is complaining about PC gaming, copyright protection, slow internet, and updates...in 2001. 241;65 Hmmm...major drop in traffic. :(</p>
<p><b>9-19-17</b> <a href="http://www.audiovisualizers.com/">Old-Site of the Day: AudioVisualizers.com</a> A website about video synthesizers, started in 1999. Fairly large, with an inconsistant layout.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+1%3A13-14&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Ezekiel 1:13-14</a> 643;96</p>
<p><b>9-18-17</b> <A href="http://7search.com/">Old-Site of the Day: 7Search.com</a> I was researching some of the sites who's buttons I posted on 9/13, only to discover that one recently closed. 7Search was, till July 31, an online ad company and pay-per-click search service. Went through Archive.org to trace the site's development. Can't really call this a history report, since I don't know anything about the company's internal practices, but it still may be interesting: <ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991013061925/http://7search.com:80/"> This is the earliest crawl the Internet Archive has of 7Search, from 1999.</a> The page includes a search box and a long feature list. It only indexed the most popular search terms, but users could create a "search agent" then receive results as an email if the engine didn't have any relevant sites. It used links to determine popularity, like Google or Infoseek. It had PPC results. The owners tried to de-emphasize this in the engine's marketing; it's mentioned at the bottom of the page, and they compare it to the Yellow Pages, to note that print resources already charge for listings. Paid Search was still new. Even if GoTo demonstrated that it was OK, I'd imagine OpenText's failure was still first in most folk's minds.</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021128020231/http://www.7search.com:80/">Here's a later version, from 2002.</a> Has a cleaner, directory-style layout, and a rather neat animated logo. Looks like the WayBack Machine didn't crawl their directory deeply enough for it to be useful as an historical resource.<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050706031519/http://www.7search.com:80/">Still another version, from 2005</a> Drops the directory, starts emphasizing their ad features.</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140329121447/http://7search.com:80/">A later version, from 2014.</a> Even greater emphasis on their ad network, but it still appears to have a small search bar.</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161030013001/http://7search.com:80/">Their last major redesign, crawled in 2016.</a> Dropped the search bar entirely to focus on advertising. Looks like they still offered a search engine for affiliates.</li></ul>Bible Verse of the Day: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+30%3A24-28&amp;version=HCSB">Proverbs 30:24-28</a> 867;121

<p><b>9-16-17</b> <a href="http://www.thevideograveyard.com/">Old-Site of the Day: The Video Graveyard</a> Reviews B-movies and horror movies, since '97. I haven't looked this site over very much; I don't know if it's family-friendly or not, so be warry. Found this via a link in another B-Movie site I visit.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+14:18&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day Numbers 14:18</a> 386;63</p>

I didn't know .info sites existed in '95; I'm betting the webmaster bought a domain name later.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?qs_version=HCSB&amp;quicksearch=info&amp;begin=53&amp;end=53">Bible Verse of the Day: 1 Corinthians 12:3</a><br><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uk-police-using-detection-dogs-133100711.html">So the Police have USB detecting dogs.</a> 894;135</p>

<p><b>9-13-17</b> Well, I'm glad it's not Friday. ;)<br><a href="http://www.fishthe.net/search1.htm">Old-Site of the Day: Christian Mega Search</a> Growing dissatisfied with Google, I decided to search for a Christian Search Engine. (Using Google, of course.) This was on the 1st page. Not a search engine itself, but a list of links to search engines. Includes a lot of nice buttons: <br><img src="https://websitering.neocities.org/BANNERS/7search.gif" alt="7Search Banner">

<p><b>9-7-17</b> <a href="http://www.oocities.org/capecanaveral/lab/8803/fcometcr.htm">Old-Site of the Day: DeHavilland Comet Homepage</a> The DeHavilland Comet was the first jet airliner. An innovative, and I must say, beautiful plane, the 1st version had a fatal design flaw which caused two planes to break up mid-flight. While trying to find information which did not come from Wikipedia, I found this archived Geocities site. It has everything you could ask for: contemporary news articles, photos broken down by plane model and registration number. Everything! And Yahoo decided to delete this. Geocities wasn't just a collection of goofy GIFs folks. There should be more sites like this.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+4%3A1-2&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Acts 4:1-2</a> 177;119</p>
