<h1>September 2020</h1>

<p><b>9-30-2020</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%201:9-10&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: Philippians 1:9-10</a> 

<p><b>9-29-2020</b> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001110041900/http://www.radiocity.com/pokemon/index.htm">Old-Site of the Day: DiamondBadge.com</a> Watched a very small bit of <i>Pokemon Live</i> yesterday. The announcer mentioned this site as [part of the story, so I had to see where it led in reality. Today, it's parked, but back-in-the-day it led to this page about the show.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203:20-21&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: John 3:20-21</a>

<p><b>9-28-2020</b> Wow; where has the month gone? Each day seems incredibly slow, but we're already at the end of the month. How did that happen?<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+4%3A7-5%3A2&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: 1 John 4:7-5:2</a> Sometimes chapter divisions accidentally encourage us to take things out of context. Problem is, if you take the first part of chapter 5 out of context, you wind up creating a contradiction with John 3, Acts 22, etc.<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001019055538/http://www.atari2600nexus.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Atari 2600 Nexus, in 2000</a> A classic gaming siet focused on Atari's first console. Has some interesting news items from back-in-the day, when the SNES was still too new to be considered "classic." I think AtariAge's rarity guide might've been based on this site's, tho I'm not sure. At the very least they use a similar 10-point scale.

<p><b>9-25-2020</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A1-3&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: 1 John 2:1-3</a>

<p><b>9-22-2020</b> <a href="http://www.orubin.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Orubin.com</a> "Welcome to The World Of Owen Rubin.
Here you will find my stories about Atari and Bally, two of the early pioneer companies in coin-operated video games, and the games and toy I designed or worked on while working there." Sounds like fun! Since 2001.

<p><b>9-21-20</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+13%3A11-14&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: 2 Corinthians 13:11-14</a>

<p><b>9-17-2020</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A1-7&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: Ephesians 5:1-7</a><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19980202091957/http://www.bubandbob.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Bub And Bob.com, in 1998</a> This was a large fan site for Taito's arcade game, but it's gone off line. Here is the first crawl the Wayback Machine has.

<p><b>9-16-2020</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%203:13&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: James 3:13</a><br><a href="https://www.beattycircus.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Clyde Beatty Cirus</a> Clyde Beatty was an animal trainer who became famous in the 1st half of the 20th century. He tamed lions, tigers, bears, etc. He died in 1965 from cancer. This was a new show named in his honor. The site's hard to navigate; navigation relied on Flash, which is unusable on Chrome. (I'm using Chrome now.) Here's a list of the site's pages, via Google: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk01ybPNUYc2uJA9q8c8PrkJDpLfa6Q%3A1600272706510&amp;source=hp&amp;ei=QjliX8elHJKYsAWhno64CA&amp;q=site%3Abeattycircus.com%2F&amp;oq=site%3Abeattycircus.com%2F&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoECCMQJzoKCC4QxwEQrwEQJzoICAAQsQMQgwE6CwguELEDEMcBEKMCOgUIABCxAzoICC4QxwEQrwE6AggAOggILhCxAxCDAToFCC4QsQNQ9AlYt0pgq0xoAXAAeACAAbIBiAGrBpIBAzcuMpgBAKABAaABAqoBB2d3cy13aXo&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHztmxiO7rAhUSDKwKHSGPA4cQ4dUDCAk&amp;uact=5">Not exhaustive, but better than nothing.</a> Since at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061110154631/https://www.beattycircus.com/">2006.</a>

<p><b>9-14-2020</b> <a href="https://atariage.com/forums/topic/310753-curt-vendel-has-passed-away/">Curt Vendel Died the Week Before Last</a> He was 53. I wasn't able to post this last week because a lot was going on. He was the owner of <a href="http://atarimuseum.com/">AtariMuseum</a>, & he was working on a series of books on the company's history. This really does a poor job explainig everything the man did for the Atari community; I reccomend reading that thread.  (Note I originally said Curt Vendel was 54. Too Young either way.)

Thank you!<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+46%3A1-4&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: Isaiah 46:1-4</a><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041211002810/http://www.elook.org/">Old-Site of the Day: eLook.org, in 2004</a> eLook was a reference site, sort of an online encyclopedia, with a dictionary, atlas, & video game cheat codes. This is a very early version of the site, but they already claim to have over 100k pages of content.

<p><b>9-9-2020</b> Finally, a new file for a new month!<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+2%3A11-15&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: Titus 2:11-15</a><br><a href="https://www.cafedvd.com/cgi-bin/new/index.html">Old-Site of the Day: CafeDVD</a> Researching old video-steraming services led me to research Netflix, which led me to this early competitor...for online DVD rentals.
