<p><b>9-11-19</b> I wanted to post Excite's homepage from 2001, but it looks like the Wayback machine didn't crawl the site deeply enough to save any of the articles. So...<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16%3A33&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: John 16:33</a><br>Maybe I should post Excite anyways, to show what it looked like...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010911200841/http://www.excite.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Excite.com, on This Day in 2001</a>

<p><b>9-10-19</b> Don't know if I'll be on tomorrow, so I must post this today. <A href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010911200318/http://www.cnn.com/">Old-Site of the Day: CNN.com, on September 11, 2001</a> That's from the wayback machine, but it looks like they've left the main article <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/09/11/worldtrade.crash/index.html">online, untouched.</a>

<p><b>9-9-19</b> <a href="http://www.digicamhistory.com/">Old-Site of the Day: DigitalCamHistory.com</a> "The first ever, and still by far the most complete virtual history museum of film camera to digital photography and space exploration imagers on the web" Since 2001. Found via a Wikipedia link. <br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=HCSB&amp;search=Titus%202:2">Bible Verse of the Day: Titus 2:2</a> Note it the "are to be;" you don't automatically become wise with age.
