Besides that, there's a lot of new competition. The owner moved the business from a store front to his basement, & cut back on staff. His kids aren't interested in the studio, so it'll probably close when he retires. :( 356;104

I miss game sites like this; simple things made by one or two people in their spare time, but with a ton of info. And fast; most indipendent sites today are on some sort of bloated blogging platform. Sadly, it looks like this site has some sort of problem which keeps me from looking at their lists of games, & it looks like the Internet Archive didn't crawl deeply enough to save the game pages either. Even <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site:retrobase.net&amp;ei=sZJ9W-GyPMuLjwSB3b4o&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=755">Google</a> doesn't seem to have links to the deeper pages saved. :( 521;128

DMOZ was a (nearly) 20 year old web directory organized by volunteers. It broke web pages into a series of categories users could browse through.

By <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000302041352/http://www.gamegenie.com/">2000</a> the video game site had taken over the domain. Looks like they used to offer news & reviews too. Has nothing to do with the Galoob game enhancement toy, from what I can tell. 370;95
