<h1>Jan. 2019</h1>

<p><b>1-31-19</b> Last day of the month... Time's moving <i>so fast</i>, but each day feels <i>so slow</i>...<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6:4&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Romans 6:4</a><br><a href="http://www.streamlinefilms.com/">Old-Site of the Day: StreamLineFilms.com</a> Distributes stockfootage, including clips from <i>Planet of [the] Dinosaurs.</i> Inspired the name of Streamline Pictures, Carl Macek's old anime distribution company. Their website first appears in the Wayback Machine in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000824073005/http://www.streamlinefilms.com/">2000</a>, but wasn't really ready till <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031222233221/http://www.streamlinefilms.com/">2003</a>. Nice old layout, which hasn't changed much.
<p><b>1-30-18</b> <a href="http://www.laurelandhardy.org/">Old-Site of the Day: LaurelAndHardy.org</a> An online magazine by a fan club from the UK. Earliest archive's from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990508222749/http://members.aol.com/oxford0614/">1999</a>, when it was hosted at AOL.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+12%3A25-30&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Matthew 12:25-30</a>
<p><b>1-29-18</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+9%3A35-37&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Mark 9:35-37</a><br><a href="http://www.solarguard.com/">Old-Site of the Day: SolarGuard.com</a> About <i>Tom Corbett, Space Cadet</i> & other 50's TV Sci-Fi heroes. Since at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981111191643/http://www.solarguard.com/">1998</a>. Based, in part, on a Fanzine the webmaster worked on in the 70's. Has a forum...which is more like a letters section; the webmaster didn't use forum software; people emailed their comments to him, & he'd post 'em.
<p><b>1-28-19</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+3%3A1-5&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: John 3:1-5</a><br><a href="http://www.pharis-video.com/p4589.htm">Old-Site of the Day: Chuck Pharis Web Page</a> About old TV Broadcasting equipment. I linked to a page on DuMount's Electronicam.
<p><b>1-26-19</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+2%3A40-47&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: Acts 2:40-47</a><br><a href="http://www.acme.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Acme.com</a> A software company which has been around since the 80's. Their site looks almost exactly the same as it did in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961023173924/http://www.acme.com/">1996.</a>
<p><b>1-25-19</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+34%3A6-8&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Exodus 34:6-8</a><br><a href="http://tuxgraphics.org/">Old-Site of the Day: TuxGraphics.org</a> A collection of projects, from at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031118210252/http://tuxgraphics.org/">2003</a> when it was called Katja's Graphics Corner. Electronics, Graphics, & Penguins!
<p><b>1-24-19</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A15-21&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Romans 6:15-21</a> Some have said Paul & James contradict each other on Faith & Works, but I don't see it. It's just algebra; if A=B then B must equal A. James says you must have works to show you have faith; Paul says if you have Faith you'll have works.<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010620075325/http://personal.nbnet.nb.ca/mcnally/bhive/index.html">Old-Site of the Day: The B-Hive, in 2001</a> While browsing Badmovies.org's forum, I found a link to this site. It's gone offline, like many small sites, but is saved in the Wayback Machine. While it looks like the Internet Archive only got a few captures, there is enough to explore, so have fun!
<p><b>1-23-19</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A14-26&amp;version=HCSB"> Bible Verse of the Day: James 2:14-16</a><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970412010156/http://www.absolute-playstation.com">Absoulte Playstation, In 1997</a> While looking for <i>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</i>-related sites, I stubled onto GameRankings, which listed this site as a reviewer. The site's gone, but the archive could be fun to browse. 
<p><b>1-22-19</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=HCSB&amp;search=Matthew%207:7-8">Bible Verse of the Day: Matthey 7:7-8</a><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971210121153/http://www.inkspot.com:80/">Old-Site of the Day: InkSpot.com, in 1997</a> While exploring the archived version of yesterday's old-site, I came across an article noting that Inkspot, another major writing site, was closing. They'd been bought by a media company which was beginning to feel the FX of the Dot Com Bubble. Too bad; it looks like a lovely site, with a layout which gholds up today. This is the earliest working archive I can find; I believe it went off line around 2001. (Don't quote me on that; it could've been earlier.) The domain name still exists, but it's just a place holder with a link to another writing site. Such is the way of the web...
<p><b>1-21-19</b> Happy Martin Luther King Day!</b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A25-37&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Luke 10:25-37</a><br><a href="http://www.writing-world.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Writing-World.com</a> 'Hosted by writer/editor Moira Allen, Writing-World.com has been one of the web's leading "go-to" sites for writers since 2000!

<p><b>1-3-19</b> I'm still trying to get used to typing "19" for the year...<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+2%3A2-12&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Titus 2:2-12</a><br><a href="http://www.rickstv.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Rick's TV Homepage</a> Online since at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050814233139/http://www.rickstv.com/">2005,</a> but old-school even then, this site is a large collection of video info the webmaster found interesting or nostalgic. Divided into sections called Channels, just like a real TV. 
<p><b>1-2-19</b> Happy 2019 everybody! This is the 1st official update for the new year, so let's get things started off right with <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=HCSB&amp;search=Psalm%2090:12">Psalm 90:12</a><br>And what about the Old-Site of the Day? How about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991114193626/http://y2kinfo.com/">Y2KInfo.com, in 1999.</a> "Could that technological dynamo of the nineties get whacked by Y2K?" "How can industry trade groups pronounce telecommunications companies and gas and electric utilities compliant when financial analysts say otherwise?" "What is Y2K?" I dunno, but my Tandy thinks it's 1918. ;) Have a happy New Year folks, and I wish peace & prosperity to you in the comming months. 303;94
