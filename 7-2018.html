Wonder if they still do...<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A14-16&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Matthew 5:14-16</a><br><a href="https://futurism.com/a-new-ai-can-write-music-as-well-as-a-human-composer/">Artificial Intelligence Composes Music</a> O_o >_< Oh, I know it's cool. I know I'd like an instant music maker if I was working on a movie or game. Still... Think of the implications. What will this do for society?
