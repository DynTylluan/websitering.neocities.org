Here it is, a description of what a Tide Pod'll do if you put it in your mouth.</a> Basically the pH levels are low enough to cause burns, and the gel-like consistency gives it a chance to <i>really</i> burn you. Can cause bleeding and swelling. If you inhale, it can cause lung problems. I'd imagine most kids think it's something like bar or hand soap, but it sounds a bit closer to drain cleaner. (Note: That does not mean "eat regular soap." It means "eat edible things, not cleaning agents.") 502;77</p>
