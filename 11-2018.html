Giant people,giant rats, giant ants. I usually like his movies, even if they aren't "good" they're fun.

(And SMBHQ, for now.) VGF was the old-site of the day awhile back. Their old websites had good contempory information on early 2000's games.<br>Also, it appears WebRings.org has removed their site hosting capabilities, which has created a lot of broken rings. Sad; WebRings was sort of the last official remnant of the U.S. version of Geocities. (WebRings was bought by Yahoo, who combined it with Geocities for awhile. Yahoo sold WebRings off a few years before shutting down Geocities.) 359;92

<p><b>11-10-18</b> About Districts: It's a good idea, & it's well made. It obviously took a lot of time & thought; the folks who made it aren't idiots. I've just seen a lot of dead directories, so I'm not as excited as I could be.

It's a directory of Neocities sites, broken down into major topics, then organized alphabetically. I wish them well, tho I'm not sure they realize how much work goes into a good directory. Seems to be a response to <a href="https://mariteaux.neocities.org/essays/webrings.html">Site-Rings,</a> but directories & rings suffer some of the same problems. Starting is easy, but once sites begin to close or move things get hard fast. A broken ring is unusable to be sure, but a directory of 90% dead links is just as useless, & fixing broken links takes time away from adding new links. Still cool tho.<br><a href="http://sattlers.org/mickey/">Old-Site of the Day: Sattlers.org</a> A Homepage for Michael 'Mickey' Sattler.

Also sells films. Yesterday's Old-Site had a small poem on it, about keeping film from tearing itself up. The website's author didn't know who wrote it. This site does. I linked to the page with the poem; I'll post a copy here too; it should be in the public domain: <i>"I am celluloid, not steel, Oh God of the machine, have mercy, I front dangers whenever I travel the whirling wheels of the mechanism. Over the sprocket  wheels, held tight by the idlers, I am forced by the motor's might. If a careless  hand misthreads me, I have no alternative but to go to my death. If the pull on  the take-up reel is too violent,  I am torn to shreds.  If dirt collects in the aperture my film of beauty is streaked and marred, and I must face my   beholders-A thing shamed and be spoiled. I travel many miles in tin cans, I am tossed on heavy trucks,  sideways and upside down. See that I don't become bruised and wounded beyond the power to heal.  I am a delicate ribbon of film - misuse me and I disappoint  thousands; cherish me, and   I delight and instruct the world." Written by A.P. Hollis, a film distributor for home movies, in 1920.</i> Oldest Archive: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010813191046/http://www.robbiesreels.com/">2001, which should be when the site was started, according to the copyright.</a> 536;94
