After a little digging, I was able to find the program's old webpage: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000301175754/http://www.users.uswest.net/~sdiggins/bcx.htm">here, from 2000</a>. <a href="http://bcx-basic.sourceforge.net/">And here's the SourceForge page</a>.

<p><b>8-4-2020</b> <a href="https://www.koin.com/news/protests/night-64-portland-firefighters-for-blm-vigils-and-community-healing/">Protests in Portland</a> Read on some conservative sites that there was a book burning. Couldn't be sure; that seemed extreme, fear-mongering, yellow journalism. Then I tracked down this from a local TV-news site. "1 a.m.

Around 12:30 a.m. people began starting a fire in the street in front of the federal courthouse which started with burning a bible, then an American flag, until more and more items were added. Finally around 1 a.m., yellow clad members of the group Moms United for Black Lives Matter went over to the fire and put it out with bottles of water and stamped it out." :(
