I guess Adobe has a lot of other software to sell (wll, rent) while Real does not. In light of that, I've been looking for soem sites which still use RealPlayer. That leads us to the <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ar2/thefoxden/sounds.html">Old-Site of the Day: Sounds of the Fox</a> Part of an AngleFire site called The Fox Den, this is a collection of Wave & RealAudio files featuring foxes barking, yipping, etc. It's been updated to include a YouTube video, but otherwise is about the same as it was in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010408191938/http://www.angelfire.com/ar2/thefoxden/sounds.html">2001.</a> Here's<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ar2/thefoxden/">the current main index</a>, incase anyone's interested.
  
  <p><b>2-22-2020</b> Well, Flash will be discontnued at the end of the year. Adobe will still offer the animation program, under a new name as a subscription. But I don't want to subscribe; that's expensive. <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/policy-pricing/macromedia-legacy-activation-error.html">Looks like Adobe made activation codes for Flash 2004 avaliable for free.</a> I might have a demo copy somewhere; I'll have to check & see if it'll work. They've provided activation codes to several other old Macromedia products they own as well; here's <a href="https://websitering.neocities.org/adobeactivate.txt">a backup list,</a> incase Adobe takes the page down. I doubt a list of product names & codes are copyrightable, even if it is it's only a small part of the webpage, & Adboe can't make money off something they're giving away, & I'm not making money off it, so this should be fair use. Actually, it looks like the <i>entire page</i> is under a noncommercial share-alike license, so this is fine. :) Thanks Adobe!

While researching it I found this fan site. The site was created in 1998 & last updated in <a href="http://home.hiwaay.net/~lkseitz/comics/AtariForce/i_new.shtml">2008</a>. <a href="http://home.hiwaay.net/~lkseitz/comics/AtariForce/af_faq.shtml">The site also includes a FAQ written in 1995.</a> Sounds like the webmaster made it for Usenet, then included it on his site when he set the site up. <a href="https://websitering.neocities.org/AtariForce.txt">I'm including a copy on my site too,</a> since the FAQ is under a free-for-noncommercial-use license. The comic was a short-lived sci-fi series where the main characters were named after Atari games. Written in the early 80's. The issue I read was weird, but not bad.<br><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/after-nearly-100-years-indiana-amusement-park-to-close-with-rides-moving-to-other-parks/ar-BB108IOZ?ocid=spartandhp">Indiana Beach Closing</a> The amusement park's parent company would rather invest in other parks.

Tatsunoko Pro's the company which made <i>Speed Racer</i> & <i>Gatchaman</i>. If Wikipedia's right Nippon TV bought controling interest in them a few years ago. Either way, this is a nice, simple site which could've been made in the late 90's. Lists their titles, with descriptions & a few screen shots. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001017115233/http://www.tatsunoko.co.jp/english/02products/index.html">Here's what their site looked like in 2000.</a> Different graphics, but a similar layout. <br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A35-37&amp;version=ESV">Bible Verse of the Day: Romans 8:35-37</a>
