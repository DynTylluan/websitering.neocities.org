The Webmaster's family bought one-back-in-the-day, and they still wanted to use it! (They had a bunch of old tapes.)<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A4-6&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Acts 2:4-6</a> 608;145</p>

It's an old directory of Nintendo sites, hosted on a free server back in the early 2000's. No longer there, but preserved in the Wayback Machine.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+14%3A21-23&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Numbers 14:21-23</a> 420;80</p>

Jenkins Day was a 20th century sci-fi author who usually wrote under the name Murray Leinster. He wrote a ton of stories, which this site lists. Since at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205114750/https://www.sfsite.com/~silverag/leinster.html">1998.</a> Some of his stories have fallen into the public domain and can be read online at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?query=leinster">Project Gutenberg.</a> Usually a fun read. 471;86</p>
<p><b>2-23-18</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+5%3A20&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Isaiah 5:20</a><br><a href="https://xpda.com/">Old-Site of the Day: XPDA.com</a> A large old homepage, online since at least 2001. has collections of interesting articles aranged alphabetically. I don't know why more sites don't use alphabetical indices; do they think the dictionary's hard to navigate? Some cool things: <a href="https://xpda.com/floppies/">80's Shareware,</a> <a href="https://xpda.com/alaska/">Pics of Alaska,</a> <a href="http://rwebster.com/">the webmaster's old site,</a> <a href="https://xpda.com/bugs/pic.aspx">a searchable database of bug photos,</a> <a href="https://xpda.com/photomud/">Photo Mud editing/viewing/organizing program,</a> <a href="https://xpda.com/messiah/">Handel's Messiah Recordings.</a> This is just a sample; there's a lot more there that might tickle your fancy. 746;134</p>
<p><b>2-22-18</b> <a href="http://www.filewatcher.com/">Old-Site and Search Engine of the Day: FileWatcher.com</a> Looks through FTP sites for files. Indexes over a billion of 'em. You can search by file name and path OR file contents. Also has an FTP directory and a list of FTP servers. Online since '97.

<p><b>2-21-18</b> ZSPlanet's made a nice-looking HTML <a href="https://zsplanet.neocities.org/pages/codetesterv1.html">Code Tester.</a> Try your ideas here!<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+17%3A10&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Jeremiah 17:10</a><br><a href="https://inducks.org/">Old-Site of the Day: I.N.D.U.C.K.S.</a> A very serious-looking database...about Disney comics. According to Wikipedia it's been online sice '94. (Yeah, Wikipedia's not a great source, but for something casual it's okay.) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031120012924/https://inducks.org/">First appears in the Wayback Machine in 2003.</a> Surprisingly, the old layout looks less technical than the current one!</p>
<p><b>2-20-18</b> Over 30k views. Thank You!<br><a href="http://psychosaurus.com/plain/">Old-Site of the Day: Psychosaurus.com</a> Has a large cover archive for <i>Turok, Son of Stone</i>, the 50's-70's comic book about an American Indian lost in a world of dinosaurs. Also has sections on DOOM, dinosaurs, the author's art, and Wally Wood, a comic-book artist. Last updated in 2002. Really nice layout, with good use of mouse roll-over FX.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A27&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Genesis 1:27</a><br>It's fairly rare for me to find a new search engine, but today I did. Meet <a href="http://swoogle.umbc.edu/2006/">the Search Engine of the Day: Swoogle.</a> Created by <a href="https://ebiquity.umbc.edu/person/html/Li/Ding/?prj=on#prj">Li Ding</a> for indexing the Semantic Web. From what I've read the engine only collects and indexes meta-data. <a href="https://ebiquity.umbc.edu/paper/html/id/304/Search-Engines-for-Semantic-Web-Knowledge">This looks like a paper describing it.</a> 485;96</p>
<p><b>2-19-18</b> <a href="http://bailsprojects.com/whoswho.aspx">Old-Site of the Day: Who's Who of American Comic Books</a> A simple serchable database of U.S. comics artists. Apparently left un-updated since the author passed away in 2006, but it still works. Doesn't appear in the Wayback Machine till 2006, so I have no idea how old this really is. A print version was compiled in the 70's tho.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+16:16&amp;version=HCSB">Bible verse of the Day: Romans 16:16</a> 435;134</p>

<p><b>2-17-18</b> <a href="http://www.hypno-movies.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Hypno-Movies.com</a> Found this when trying to look up a VHS I bought yesterday. It's about movies where hypnosis or mindcontrol is a part of the plot.

<p><b>2-13-18</b> Luckily, this isn't a Friday.<br><a href="http://www.magazineart.org/">Old-Site of the Day: MagazineArt.com</a> Scans of magazine covers, from the early 20th century to the 70's. Pre-1923 magazines have higher quality scans, since they're in the public domain in the U.S.; later scans are just "fair use" examples. First appears in the Wayback Machine in 2001, but it looks like it wasn't working till <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020605145606/http://www.magazineart.org/">2002.</a><br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+33:29&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Deuteronomy 33:29</a> Part of Moses' blessing to Israel, from just before he died and they entered the promised land.<br>Just testing some things for a slight re-do of this site, which will hopefully make it easier to search.

<p><b>2-12-18</b> <a href="http://www.dieselsweeties.com/ics/485/">Someone posted this link</a> to AtariAge today. Made me smile.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+4:7&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Genesis 4:7</a><br> <a href="http://optigan.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Optigan.com</a> From their homepage in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991128173253/http://optigan.com/">1999:</a> "Welcome to the world of the OPTIGAN (NOT "Optigon," "Optagon" or "Octagon!")! In the early 70's, Mattel devised this OPTIcal orGAN to play back the sounds of REAL instruments, encoded on celluloid discs like concentric rings of movie soundtrack. The result was pretty crappy sounding and soon forgotten by the world at large, but if this sounds to you like perfect fodder for an obsessive, almost fetishistic website, then you're absolutely correct!" 789;121</p>

<p><b>2-9-18</b> Fixed a typo from yesterday; it's not "bropadcasting."<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+45%3A5-13&amp;version=HCSB">BibleVerse of the Day: Genesis 45:5-13</a><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010301184422/http://allmovie.com:80/">Old-Site of the Day: All Movie Guide, in 2001</a> For the past few months I've thought we neeed another mivie site, besides IMDb. I went to an archived version of DMOZ to see what was avaliable. I remember using All Movie a bit in highschool, tho I don't remember it looking like this. <a href="https://www.allmovie.com/">Still around today.</a> 361;118</p>
<p><b>2-8-18</b> <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~hdtv/History/RKOGeneral/Mutual.html">Old-Site of the Day: Mutual Broadcasting System</a> What if a TV network was opperated as a co-op? E.g. The stations own the network; the network doesn't own the stations. Mutual, a U.S. radio network in the 30's oeeprated that way. Here's an article on their history. <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~hdtv/">Snyder's Boathouse,</a> the homepage of John snyder, a broadcast engineer who likes broadcast history. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205160139/http://home.earthlink.net/~hdtv/">Since at least '98</a><br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+22%3A10-24&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Acts 22:10-24</a> 555;142</p>

<p><b>2-6-18</b> Bit of sad news this morning: IMDb's deleted their archive of Usenet reviews. The IMDb/Reviews pages were one of the first Old-Sites I pointed out, and I will miss them. They represented sort of an alternate reality IMDb, free of ads and bloated code. (I don't mind ads, but I do mind bloat!) Besides, they were historic; IMDb got it's start on Usenet. There are other archives, like Google Groups, which contain much more content, but they're not as convenient. I can't even use Google Groups with Jscript off. <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rec.arts.movies.reviews">Here's rec.art.movies.reviews</a> on Google Groups.<br><a href="http://www.kickstartnews.com/index.html">Old-Site of the Day: KickStartNews</a> No relation to the modern crowdfunding platform, as far as I know. This was a technology review site from 2000 to 2012. Some fairly well-written reviews, but few pictures. Nice, clean layout. They planned to re-launch in 2015, but it looks like that didn't happen.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+11%3A1-18&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Acts 11:1-18</a> 659;130</p>

Gemtree Software offered a programming language for kids called Peter. It allowed programs to be "assembled using the mouse like a jigsaw puzzle." There was a freeware "lite" version, which you may be able to get from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171113192003/http://www.gemtree.com/DOWNLOAD/pet223en.exe">Wayback Machine.</a> Description page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171113192003/http://www.gemtree.com/peter.htm">there.</a> They had a fair ammount of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620153757/http://www.gemtree.com:80/program.htm">software</a> designed with Peter.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+11%3A1-6&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Leviticus 11:1-6</a> 586;81</p>
