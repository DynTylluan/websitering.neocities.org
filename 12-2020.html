<p><b>12-3-2020</b> Even if I had the skills to repair a Centipede arcade game, I don’t have the time. And yet still... Maybe I watched <i>The Brave Little Toaster</i> too much as a kid, but I hate throwing things out. It’s probably for the best that I couldn’t lift it; there’s some danger that I could turn into the Collier brothers.

<p><b>12-2-2020</b> Got someone to help lift, & went back after work to see if we could get the Centipeed cabinet. It was gone. Yesterday was trash day, so there may be one fewer Centipeed machine in the world. :( Then again, the machine's back & top pannel had come off, & they were still sitting by the rod. I'd think the trash men would've picked those up, so maybe there's hope? 

<p><b>12-1-2020</b> Found a Centipeed arcade game by the road this morning, but I could not lift it into my truck. Someone offered to help, but if even if we'd gotten it into the truck, I would'nt have had anyone to help get it out. :(
