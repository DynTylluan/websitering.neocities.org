<br><a href="DMOZMemory.html">Goodbye DMOZ</a>
<br><a href="minisearchenginereviews.html">Decent Search Engines (That are Not Google.)</a>
<br><a href="neutral.html">A brief History of the Net and Net Neutrality</a>
<br><a href="rcookie.html">On the Rainbow Cookie Meme</a>
<br><a href="roto.html">RotoScope: A Forgotten Widescreen Movie Process</a>
<br><a href="ScrubTheWebIsGone.html">ScrubTheWeb Stops Running Their Search Engine; Domain for Sale</a>
<br><a href="two.html">Two-Columns: Will they work on a phone?</a> Really, not an article; but still a nice test.
<br><a href="websitering.html">WebSiteRing: Create one without scripting</a> The first thing I wrote for this site.
<br><a href="pkmn/menu.html">The Classic Pokemon Page</a> A collection of nostalgic thoughts on the franchize, influenced by late 90's fan sites.

I must note that I didn't create everything here; quotes, site buttons, images & the like are still property of their creators; you'll have to check with them for use requirements.
