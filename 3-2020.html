<h1>March 2020</h1>

<p><b>3-14-2020</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+1%3A3-8&amp;version=ESV">Bible Verse of the Day: 2 Peter 1:3-8</a><br><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ego/g_saga/">Old-Site of the Day: The Godzilla Saga</a> RARRRRRRRRR!!!!! An anglefire fan site about Toho's vererable giant monster, with a few articles on other series. Judging by the updates on the 1st page this site dates back to at least 2005.

<p><b>3-13-2020</b> Wow, it's Friday the 13th. Didn't realize it would be this month till yesterday, so I don't have anything lined up. :/<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A26-30&amp;version=ESV">Bible Verse of the Day: Romans 8:26-30</a><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070103134739/http://www.coldfusionvideo.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Cold Fusion Video Reviews</a> This was one of my favorite sites late in highschool, but a server crash took it offline. A domain squatter took over the site a few years later. They added a Robots.txt file, so by the time I made this site there wasn't even anything left in the WayBackMachine. Today, luckily, Archive.org has removed their Robots.txt restrictions, so I can show it to you! It's a B-Movie review site by Nathan Shumate. Here's his <a href="https://nathanshumate.com/">current site.</a> The sci-fi, fantasy, & horror reviews are just perfect for Friday the 13th, no? It also has reviews of old kids flicks, and westerns.

<p><b>3-11-2020</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&amp;search=Deuteronomy%207:9">Bible Verse of the Day: Deuteronomy 7:9</a>

<p><b>3-10-2020</b> <A href="http://www.mr-video.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Mr. Video</a> One of the few remainig independent video rental stores. Shoot, one of the few remaning video rental stopes, <i>period;</i> no need to add the qualifer with Blockbuster, Hollywood Video, & Hastings gone. The oldest version i can find of their site actually has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010401235455/http://www.mr-video.com/">link to Amazon.</a> Something ironic about that...

<p><b>3-8-2020</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+5%3A14-16&amp;version=ESV">Bible Verse of the Day: James 5:14-16</a>


<p><b>3-6-2020</b> <a href="https://waltdatedworld.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Walt Dated World</a> "Since 2001, the home for all of your favorite
Walt Disney World 
attractions that no longer exist!" <br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter+2:16&amp;version=ESV">Bible Verse of the Day: 1 Peter 2:16</a>

<p><b>3-5-2020</b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM6X2MEl7R8">Warner Chapel Music...Oh boy.</a> A YouTuber posted a video arguing that a Katie Parie song didn't infringe on another song's copyright. Then her publisher claimed his video. 

<p><b>3-4-2020</b> <a href="https://www.popcorn-song.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Popcorn-Song.com</a> A fan page for the early electronic song Popcorn. Give's the song's history, & lists different versions of the song. Since 2005. Just found this a few minutes ago in a YouTube commment. Who says all YouTube comments are worthless?
