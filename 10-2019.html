<p><b>10-31-19</b> Happy Halloween Everybody, & others with no body... Mwa! Ha! Ha! ;)

<p><b>10-29-19</b> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970615013430/http://home1.gte.net/bstanton/video.html">Old-Site of the Day: Vectrex: The Ultimate Video Game System</a> Going through Classic Gaming Nexus' archive of deleted sites brings us to this Vectrex fan page. From the front page: "The VECTREX was introduced back around 1982 and became almost immediately an expensive 'cult' hit among hard core video gamers who lusted after that flickery, strange vectorgraph display used in so many great classics as ASTEROIDS, BATTLEZONE and TEMPEST. At around $300, it was a little more expensive than other systems but not by much."

<p><b>10-28-19</b> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19980611110647/http://www.davesclassics.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Dave's Video Game Classics</a> Another one from Classic Gaming Nexus. I've seen this one listed in a lot of other places, so forgive me if I've already featured it. It was abig emulation site, focused on MAME.

<p><b>10-26-19</b> Over 88k unique views since this site launched! Thank You!

<p><b>10-23-19</b> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970703110543/http://www.xnet.com/~skelly/">Old-Site of the Day: Sean's Homepage</a> Offered information on Video Came Collecting & Multicarts. Another site from Classic Gaming Nexus' list of deleted sites.

<p><b>10-22-19</b> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991010024322/http://www.monmouth.com/~pcjohn/">Old-Site of the Day: John's Classic Game Systems Page</a> Awhile back I featured Classic Gaming Nexus, a directory of video game sites from the late 90's. Around that time I contacted the web master, & he sent me a list of sites deleted from the directory; this is one of those sites. "The hottest site on the net for classic videogamers!" With Vectrex, Coleco, QBasic games, & an Odyssey 2 multicart.

Now 23 years old.<br>

<a href="https://www.patreon.com/curlie">Curlie Now Has a Patreon</a> If you want to support the community-based continuation of DMOZ, but don't have time to edit, this is a nice place to start. A <i>very</i> nice place; web hosting for large projects is expensive.

<p><b>10-19-19</b> I wish there was a 19th month; then we could have 19-19-19. ;)<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1%3A5-10&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: 1st John Chapter 1, Verses 1-5</a> Read this book last night, & it's rather lovely, so I decided to share a bit of it today.<br><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/10/gameboard-1-digital-board-game-console-starts-kickstarter-campaign/">In Other News The Atari Box Lost Its Head Designer</a> He left awhile back to work on a board game/tablet thing.

<p><b>10-15-19</b> <a href="http://www.screenonline.org.uk/">Old-Site of the Day: BFI's Screen Online</a> Another good-looking film site, by the British Film Institute. Focuses on British film & TV. Since 2003; last updated in 2014 according to the copyright. That's the problem with finding an alternate to IMDb; it's either a new site which is just as bloated or the webmaster stopped updating; yesterday's site only includes films made before 2015. :/

<p><b>10-14-19</b> <a href="https://www.citwf.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Film Database: The Complete Index to World Film</a> An extensive, searchable, list of movies, actors, & companies. Sortof like an independently-made IMDb, but simpler, less bloated, & without reviews. I've been looking for another good movie site for awhile, & I think this might be a good choice.

It has been online for over a decade, providing valuable research information and historical recordings.

AmMusPres is owned and operated by PineTree Productions.
See the three divisions of music publications " This is a bit newer than most I list; only dates to '06 if I go by the copyright. Still an interesting site with an old-school layout.

<p><b>10-9-19</b> <a href="http://www.csufresno.edu/folklore/BalladIndexDocs.html">Old-Site of the Day: Traditional Ballad Index</a> Found this the other day when researching a song. Has info on folk songs, including the earliest date they were documented. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981202081858/http://www.csufresno.edu/folklore/BalladIndexDocs.html">Since at least 1998.</a>

<p><b>10-7-19</b> <a href="http://www.gwydir.demon.co.uk/jo/maze/index.htm">Old-Site of the Day: Jo Edkins' Maze Page</a> Checked the Wayback machine, & this page has been up since at least 1999. It's changed a bit since then, but it's still an old-style site, with a simple table based layout, a menu screen instead of a navagation bar, etc. About labrynths, not mazes. No branching paths.

<p><b>10-5-19</b> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+55%3A7&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Isaiah 55:7</a><br><a href="http://web.curryguide.com/">Old-Site of the Day: CurryGuide.com</a> Just another old web poprtal, dating to 1997 according to the copyright.
