This is just a few months after the GameCube was launched, & hopes for the system were still high.--> <br><b>Breaking News</b>...for tomorrow... I just found out a site I love will close tomorrow.  It's against the rules to say anything til then tho. I'm trembling; I'm so emotional I'm shaking. D': Bye Mozzie; I'll miss you. :'(<br>Ok. Just got an update. The site I love will announce that they're closing tomorrow but will stay open for 2 more weeks.<br>Tommorrow's news has put me in a poor mood.  So here's A Bible Verse for Today: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+1%3A12-14&amp;version=NKJV">Ecclesiastes 1:12-14</a><br>They made the official announcement early: <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/">DMOZ.org is closing on March 14.</a><br>Visits to WebSiteRing Today: 475; Unique: 205; Wow...lots of views for one day. This may be the most visits I've had in one day. Thanks!<br><br>

<b>2-23-17</b> <a href="http://bobburns.mycottage.com/">Old-Site of the Day: bobburns.mycottage.com</a> Bob Burns collected sci-fi movie props durring the 50's, 60, & 70's.

<b>2-22-17</b> <a href="http://oxberry.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Oxberry.com</a> Orxberry makes camera equipment, particularly optical printers & film scanners.  Their website first appears in Archive.org in 2001.  It disappears for about 3 years before reappearing in almost it's current form.  Optical printers were used in motion picture production  to combine two or more images before computers could do so.  They're still used in film restoration.  <a href="http://cinefex.com/blog/optical-printer/">Cinefex has a good article about their history.</a><br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+1%3A10-20&amp;version=NKJV">Bible Verse of the Day: 1 Corinthians 1:10-20</a><br>Visits to WebSiteRing Today: 89; Unique: 44<br><br>

Not bad, tho I'd like to see an online catalog, & they could've replaced that giant logo with something a bit more useful to the end consumer, like a printable coupon or a sale announcenment. Here's a link to an article about the <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/neal-rubin/2017/01/05/first-kmart-garden-city-closing/96225636/">1st Kmart closing</a><br>Bible Verse of the Day: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=numbers+13%3A21-24&amp;version=ESV">Numbers 13:21-24</a><br>Visits to WebSiteRing Today: 98; Unique: 54<br><br>

This is a bit later, has info on their 3D engine, and a cryptic list describing upcomming games. (They couldn't tell us much about them; contracts with publishers prevented it.) If you fast foward a bit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19980113110914/http://www.argonaut.com/">to 1998</a> you'll find info about one of the games they were working on: Croc: Legend of the Gobbos.  It's a fun platform adventure game, if you can get used to the sometimes frustrating camera.--><br>Bible Verse of the Day: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+41%3A1-8&amp;version=ESV">Job 41:1-8</a><br>Visits to WebSiteRing: 216; Unique: 95<br><br>

According to Alexa.com the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/magicdragon.com">trafic stats</a> you see on MagicDragon's front page are no longer accurate.

<b>2-16-17</b> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/boards/?ref_=ft_mb">IMDb Message Boards Closing</a> File this under Breaking News.  I just found out that IMDb is closing their forum, & from the looks of the announcement, they're going to delete all the content too.  That bugs me.  Even if I was never able to get an account (they wanted my phone or credit card number) I still liked the forum.  There was a link to it at the bottom of every movie's page; the comments, tho sometimes harsh, provided extra info on the movie.  I'll miss that. Doubly sad: the Internet Archive can't crawl IMDb's forum; the robot.txt file blocks them. Even the forum closing announcement is blocked.<a href="https://websitering.neocities.org/IMDbForumCloses.txt">Here's an archived version of the anouncenent, for future reference.</a> This should qualify as fair use, IMDb can't make money from a forum closing announcement, & it's a <i>very</i> small part of their site.  If soemone disagrees I can remove this.<br><a href="http://stationwagon.com/">Old-Site of the Day: StationWagon.com</a> Has information on station waggons (what else?)  Started in 1997; stopped updating in 2002 when the webmaster's life got more complex.  Used to have a messge board & a for sale section, but those are down now.  Still has a nice article on station wagon history. Uses Comic Sans, if you have that font.

It's just another early web portal, but the name sticks out.  There's a directory which may be fun to explore, tho it seems a bit on the small side.  I do like the site's funky mid-90's styling; they're even funkier than <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/19961022175004/http://excite.com">Excite in 1996</a>. Still AsiaDragons.com is well-designed & fairly easy to navigate.

TheGlobe was hit hard by the dotcom bubble, & their sites limped along til TheGlobe was sued for spamming MySpace users.

These are the oldest updates the site has archived; they're even older than what the Internet Archive has on the site.  Some of the updates were made before Serebii bought a domain name; if anyone knows his original URL they might be able to find an earlier version in the Internet Archive.  If you scroll down you can see remnants of the site's old layout.

There's <a href="http://www.atarihq.com/tsr/fds/index.html">great articles on the Famicom Disc System;</a> this may be the 1st place to give in-depth coverage of it outside of Japan.

When I first heard of web-logs, I thought they were a dumb idea, but today I realize I was wrong.  Organizing a site chronologically is much easier than developing a good hierarchy, & with a search engine or a tagging scheme users can find what they need more easily than they could with a poorly-developed hierarchy.

Sadly, the web master stopped updating it a few years ago.  Life changed; he got a family, & he had little time for updates.  It's gone offline in the past 3-days; I linked to the last version the Internet Archive has.  Maybe it'll come back.  Hey, I can hope, right? At the very least I don't want a spammer to take it over; it still has a front page ranking on Google & Yahoo for the keywords "bad" & "movie."

Developing a streaming video/audio program is a significant accomplishment, as is surviving the dot-com bubble.  While tracking users seemed horribly scummy in 1999 it seems like normal operations today, & most internet programs released in the 90's had major security flaws.
