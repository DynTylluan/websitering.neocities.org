<p><b>3-30-17</b> <a href="http://www.twmacinta.com/bddbot/">Old-Site of the Day: BDDBot Homepage</a> Anyone want to start a search engine? This is a website for a small (100k) search engine program written in Java for a mid-90's book. The author can't work on it anymore; he signed a noncompete agreement when he worked for another search company, possibly InfoSeek.  It is open source tho, so you can continue the project if you want, and for once the starting point seems small enough to wrap my head around. If you explore the site a bit you can find info on the author's other projects; he's done a lot. <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471246387.html">Here's the book, by the way.</a> If you explore a bit from there you can find info on other old search engines. <br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A30-35&amp;version=ESV">Bible Verse of the Day: Matthew 6:30-35</a><br>Visits to WebSiteRing Today: 213; Unique 111</p>

The main page has a copyright of 2003; other pages are even older. They have a link to their web designer, but it looks like the designer's gone out of business.

<p><b>3-27-17</b> <!--<a href="http://www.urbandragons.com/schulz.html">Old-Site of the Day: Urbandragons.com</a> Urban Dragons was an online comic published from the late 90's to 2005.  Early on the author tried to develop a story involving small dragons living in hiding in the modern world, sort of like <a href="http://epguides.com/Littles/">The Littles</a>. Later the comic's story kinda disappeared, so the site's more of an art gallery than a comic.  The page I picked is a tribute to Charles Shultz, the creator of Charlie Brown, from just after Shultz's death. From here you can find links to the main parts of the site.  The little dragons are cute, but they look a bit too much like Yoshi from Super Mario World.--><br>Bible Verse of the Day: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges+6%3A14-17&amp;version=ESV">Judges 6:14-17</a>

<p><b>3-24-17</b> Yesterday <a href="https://melonking.neocities.org/">Melon King<a> asked where I find "all these sites." Truth is, I don't know. Many I found in DMOZ, some were linked to by other sites, some were found with regualr web searching, others I've known of & used for a long time. A few, like badmovies.org <!--& videogamecritic.com-->, are still popular, & still rank well for common queries. Yesterday's site, <!--Pokemon Fantasy-->, I found a few years ago. I was looking for old <!--Pokemon--> sites.  I figured Googling <!--"Pokemon"--> and a free host's name would get results, & <!--Pokemon Fantasy--> was the 1st result for "<!--Pokemon--> Tripod." Google's changed their ranking now; I don't think that works anymore.  I found it again in DMOZ, a day or so before the site was shut down. <br>Visits to WebSiteRing Today: 13; Unique: 13</p>

<p><b>3-21-17</b> <!--<a href="http://www.atari7800.org/">Old-Site of the Day: Atari7800.org</a> WebSiteRing passed 7800 unique views yesterday, so now's a good time to feature this old Atari 7800 fan site. The 7800 could've been as good as the NES, but Atari ran into trouble in the mid-80's, & was split into two companies: an arcade company, & a home electronics company.  Atari's best games usually came from their arcade division, so the 7800 had a poor library in relation to the NES. (Yes, I'm using this site to go on an Atari related tangent.) This site has a nice collection of pictures, plus working links to other sites.--><br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A1-11&amp;version=ESV">Bible Verse of the Day: Romans 5:1-11</a><br>WebSiteRing Visits for today: 177; Unique: 90</p>

<p><b>3-20-17</b> Thank you for viewing my website over the weekend.  I don't know if anyone liked my DMOZ article; no one said anything.  There may be some funny characters in it.  Forgive me.  I copied & pasted it from a word processor to a text editor, & didn't catch all the errors that caused.  While no one commented on the article, a few people did comment earlier in the month, when I announced DMOZ's closure.  Thanks <a href="https://strata.neocities.org/">strata,</a> <a href="https://anlucas.neocities.org/">A.N. Lucas,</a> & <a href="https://arkmsworld.neocities.org/">arkmsworld</a>.  The editors have set up a new site at curlie.org to continue the project. There are also several mirrors where it may live on.  These include DMOZtools.net, curlz.org, free moz, & IWWT.  You can download the last RDF dump from curlz or IWWT.  The Wayback machine may have it too. I'm worried that none of these efforts will ever have any sort of prominence, that they will never get the resources they need, or that editors will continue on different services, resulting in several weak projects instead of one strong one. But worry doesn't help anyone.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A25-34&amp;version=ESV">Bible Verse of the Day: Matthew 6:25-34</a><br><a href="http://searchengineland.com/dmoz-has-officially-closed-271530">SearchEngineLand's Danny Sullivan wrote a piece on DMOZ closing on Friday.</a>  I haven't had a chance to post a link til now.  Says this is the "end of an era of humans trying to catalog the entire web." I'm still not convinced algorithms can do a better job; a faster job sure, but not better. And, technically,  <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2604824?hl=en">Google uses human editors to help them classify sites.</a> SearchEngineLand even has an <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-flag-upsetting-offensive-content-271119">article on it.</a> Also note that DMOZ editors used automatic tools to check for bad links.  The difference is in the emphasis; Google uses automatic processes with humans to back them up; DMOZ used automatic processes to back up humans. <br><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170317133330/http://www.dmoz.org/">Old-Site of the Day: DMOZ, Archived on March 17, 2017, at 13:33:30</a> This is the Wayback Machine's last working crawl of the Open Directory Project.  The next one is a goodbye message. I don't know what I'll do with the pages I saved. I'd love to show them to you, but I'd need to get permission; I don't want to mess up any attempt to restart the project.<br> WebSiteRing Visits for today: 367; Unique: 181</p>

<p><b>3-16-17</b> DMOZ is still up, but it's officially closed.  You can still view the list of sites; you can even edit if you have an account.  There's just no guarantee that anything you do from now on will be saved.<br> <a href="http://www.skrenta.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Skrenta.com</a> Rich Skrenta founded DMOZ & Blekko.

<p><b>3-15-17</b> Just checked. <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/"> As of 7:30 AM, US Central Time, DMOZ is still there.</a> Don't know how long that'll last, but it's nice. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMOZ">Wikipedia says it closed yesterday.</a> Do Wikipedia's editors actually check what they publish, or is this one of those weird cases where they just can't find a cite for something that's obvious?<br><a href="http://epguides.com/">Old-Site of the Day: epguides.com</a> Another old favorite of mine.  This one's still regulary updated, but they've never gotten rid of their simple mid-90's layout.  Epguides.com hosts episode guides for TV & Radio shows, from the late 40's til today.  Actual episode summaries are usually on other sites which epguides provides a link to. They used to have their own episode summaries; they still host a few for more obscure series.  They also host a current U.S. TV schedule, & links to TV theme songs & the like. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991012111104/http://epguides.com/">Here's what epguides looked like in 1999.</a><br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+5:11&amp;version=ESV">Bible Verse of the Day: Psalm 5:11</a><br>Visits to WebSiteRing Today: 264; Unique: 122</p>

You may want to download a few of these.  If I'm reading AOL's terms correctly you can download their content for personal use if you don't redistribute it. If you want you can download each page, saving all the graphics there. In Firefox right-click & select Save Page As; In IE goto the File menu & select Save Page As.  I don't remember how to save a page in Chrome or Safari right now. <a href="https://archive.org/web/">You can also add each page to the Wayback Machine.</a>  (Look for the add a page box in the lower right hand corner of the page. Copy & paste the URL there, then click save.  You'll have to do this for every page you want preserved.) No gurantee that AOL won't add a robot.txt file to DMOZ's domain forcing the archive to delete everything, but there's always hope, right?<br>Bible Verse of the Day: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A11-13&amp;version=NKJV">Philippians 4:11-13</a><br>Almost forgot, the large image of Mozzie on the 1st page isn't in the bookmarks, & you can't get it by downloading the page.
