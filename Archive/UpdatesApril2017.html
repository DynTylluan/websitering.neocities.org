<p><b>4-27-17</b> <a href="http://search.thunderstone.com/texis/websearch19/">Old-Site of the Day: Thunderstone's Web Site Catalog</a> Thunderstone's made enterprise search systems since the 80's. Here's one for the web. It tries to automatically organize sites into a directory. Not unusual; Infoseek tried to do the same thing in th emid-90's, & Northernlight presorted pages into categories to create a clustering search engine. Works fairly well, but it only indexes a site's home page, & some of the deeper categories need to be recrawled to remove dead links. Online since 1998, but Archive.org doesn't have anything earlier than 2013.<br> Also, <a href="http://www.heavypen.com/seo-temptation-peril-spamdexing/">here's an article on how NOT to do SEO,</a> which brings us to our <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+12%3A2&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Proverbs 12:2.</a><br><!--Added 4 more engines to DinoMultiSearch: <a href="../DinoSearch">AJKids, DogPile, EuroSeek, and MetaCrawler</a>--><br>Visits to WebSiteRing Today: 318; Unique 148</p>

<p><b>4-24-17</b> <!--<a href="http://www.ballyalley.com/">Old-Site of the Day: BallyAlley.com</a> In depth info on the Bally Astrocade, a late 70's game system.  The Astrocade was powerful for it's time, but it was poorly distributed, so it never achieved the success of the Atari 2600 or the Mattel Intellivision.  This site is old enough to have a Yahoo group. <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/ballyalley/info?showJoinPopup=true">Looks like the group's still active.</a> Interesting thing about the Astrocade: it had a built-in BASIC interpreter. People could make their own games & save them to a tape. Some of it's commercial releases were homemade BASIC games.--><br>Bible Verse of the Day: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+18%3A2&amp;version=HCSB">Proverbs 18:2</a><br>Visits to WebSiteRing Today: 176; Unique 87</p>

Lists features of the major engines that existed in 1997. Nothing on Google yet, missing NorthernLight. Google was still a graduate student experiment, so it's absense makes sense.  Not sure why Northern Light's missing. I've heard they were never able to capture much of the market. Nothing on WhatUSeek or ScrubTheWeb; guess WhatUSeek was too small, & I'm not 100% sure if ScrubTheWeb actually worked in 1997.<br>Bible Verse of the Day: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+19:11&amp;version=ESV">Genesis 19:11</a><br>Visits to WebSiteRing Today: 198; Unique: 99</p>

<p><b>4-13-17</b> <a href="http://www.spectacle.org/">Old-Site of the Day: The Ethical Specticle</a> A newsletter about ethics, politics, & morals, online since '95. Not something I'd usually post, but I found something interesting there besides the site content. <a href="http://www.spectacle.org/excite-bin/AT-newsletterssearch.cgi?doc=d2330&amp;">I found a working example of Excite for Web Servers!</a>  Here's what Excite's <a href="http://www.spectacle.org/excite-bin/AT-newsletterssearch.cgi">subject grouping</a> looked like!

<p><b>4-12-17</b> <a href="http://aliweb.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Aliweb.com</a> This was the 1st search engine for the web.  It did not look at a web site's pages; it looked for a specially-made indexing document which listed page URLs with titles, descriptions, & keywords. Seems to default to OR searching; I prefer AND searching.  Most of the links it returns are dead; I don't think they've ran their indexer in years.<br> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+20%3A1-10&amp;version=ESV">Bible Verse of the Day: John 20:1-10</a><br>Visits to WebSiteRing: 138; Unique: 62</p>


<p><b>4-11-17</b> <a href="http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN17C0D8">Anyone wanna learn COBOL?</a> Reuters  has an article stating that banks still need programers who know the old language to maintain their expensive-to-replace legacy systems.  That leads me to the <a href="http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/jsoeberg/">old-site of the day: COBOL-12.</a> Online since at least 2004, it's a download page for a free COBOL compiler...for DOS.  Actually, DOS is newer that the systems designed for COBOL; the language was designed in the 50's for mainframes & includes some legacy features which only make since in that environment, like line numbers in case someone mixed up the program's punchcards. The compiler doesn't impliment every aspect of the language, and it includes some non-standard features. That's another problem; if you got a job maintaining a legacy system you'd need to know not only the standards-compliant version of the COBOL, but also the ins-and-outs of whatever flavor the bank you worked for used.<br>Bible Verse of the Day: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+8:6&amp;version=ESV">Hebrews 8:6</a><br>Visits to WebSiteRing: 131; Unique 64</p>

<p><b>4-6-17</b> <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/specialfx2/">Old-Site of the Day: Special Effects: Titanic and Beyond</a> A PBS website about special FX, from when Titanic came out in 1998. The main menu is an image map. <!--Has a downloadable game, Attach of the 50ft. Chicken. There's different versions for Windows 3.x, 95/NT, & Mac Classic.  Any hopes for a Linux/UNIX version? ;)--> The late 90's was an interesting time for FX.  CGI was new and exciting, but movie makers still used alot of traditional FX, like glass painting.  I wish they still used some of the older techniques.  I know it's all art, but that's the point. If filmmaking is an art the techniques used to create a film are just as important as the completed film. Ah well, this isn't a movie site. <br>Bible Verse of the Day: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+34%3A6-7&amp;version=ESV">Exodus 34:6-7</a><br>Visits to WebSiteRing Today: 111; Unique: 56</p>

<p><b>4-3-17</b> <a href="http://ifindit.com/">Old-Site of the Day: iFindIt.com</a> Easynett had a whole network of sites linked together with a banner. The banner's broken, but you can take the site names, add .com or .net to them, & find them. This one's a directory of web resources, including other directories. Sadly it was never finished, & most of the other directories are gone. (I've seen this site before in a list of old websites; that's how I knew about easynett.) Easynett also operates AllNY, a minor New York news site. It was still being updated last year. AllNY's a fairy good domain name; I'd bet they make most of their money from that site.<br>BibleVerse of the Day: <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a><br>I downloaded a copy of BDD bot this weekend.  Haven't got it working yet, but I did look at the code.  It's been awhile since I programed anything, so it's a bit hard to wrap my head around it.  The engine appears to be compliant with robots.txt, which is good.  Looks like it ranks results by keyword frequency without considering position.  Doesn't appear to support boolean queries. Don't know if it would work with https; may need to be modified to index newer sites.<br>Visits to WebSiteRing: 192; Unique: 97</p>
