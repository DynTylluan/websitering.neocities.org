<b>1-31-17</b> <a href="http://www.k9web.com/">Old-Site of the Day: K9Web</a> Many old websites got their start by archiving Usenet posts; we've already covered IMDb.  Today's site contains FAQs about dogs copied from Usenet & checked by the webmaster.  The 1st page contains the site's history; click on "Dog FAQs" at the top of the screen to access the FAQs. <br>BibleVerse of the Day: <a href="http://biblehub.com/esv/luke/6.htm">Luke 6</a><br>Visits to WebSiteRing Today: 150; Unique: 71<br><br>

Turns out I made a mistake; these are the tutorials I was thinking of.  The one I linked to earlier only covers basic HTML; this one has sections for laying out your site with tables,  for creating forms, & for using frames.  They even have instruction for adding RealPlayer Audio files to your site!<br>Also of interest: Neonaut recently wrote a short <a href="https://neonaut.neocities.org/cyber/88x31.html">article on the history of 88x31 buttons.</a> It even has a button for this site! Thanks Neonaut! <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/OwlMan/Banners/Neocities_Banners.html">OwlMan has a list of 88x31 buttons</a> that have been used on NeoCities, including WebSiteRing's button.

<b>1-28-17</b> <a href="http://www.killersites.com/killerSites/">Old-Site of the Day: KillerSites.com</a> In the late 90's David Siegel wrote a book laying out ways to create visually appealing websites using avaliable technology. (Invisible GIFs, Nested Tables, etc.)  This is the book's official website. While the methods, fonts, & color schemes have changed, the basic layout of most sites hasn't changed that much.  There's a menu where you'd expect it, text where you'd expect it, titles where you'd expect them.  Most modern sites don't have an intro page, tho. (Note: I <i>like</i> intro pages.)<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A4-5&amp;version=ESV">Bible Verse of the Day: John 3:4-5</a><br>Visitors to WebSiteRing Today: 198; Unique: 89<br><br>

<b>1-24-17</b> <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/19961022175214/http://lycos.com">Old-Site of the Day: Lycos.com, in 1996</a>  Lycos was an early search engine which indexed the first few sentences on a page, plus the hundred or-so most-common words on a page.  They also had 3 directories: <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/19961023030430/http://a2z.lycos.com:80/">a subject directory,</a> a <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/19971210092412/http://cityguide.lycos.com:80/">geographic directory</a> and a <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/19961022175638/http://point.lycos.com:80/categories/">Top 5%</a> directory.  Don't take that top 5% bit too literally; consider it as a poetic way of saying "these sites are the best-of-the-best."  By the late 90's Lycos had become a <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/19990504214659/http://lycos.com">web-portal like Yahoo,</a> and they began to <a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/news/2047919/the-search-engine-update-may-1999-number#lycos">mirror DMOZ's directory.</a> Lycos still exists, but it no longer has it's own web index. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130725214655/http://fuzine.mt.cs.cmu.edu/mlm/lycos-beta.html">Here's what may be an earlier version of Lycos, when it was hosted on a university server.</a><br>While trying to find some cites on Lycos, I found this <a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/news/2063925/whats-in-a-search-engines-name">article defining search engine names.</a> Thought it was interesting enough to post.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+20:1&amp;version=ESV">Bible Verse of the Day: Psalm 20:1</a><br><b>Over 3500 views!

<b>1-23-17</b> <!--<a href="http://www.videogames.org/">Old-Site of the Day: VideoGames.org</a> VideoGames.org started in the early 90's as an online videogame museum.  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981207051844/http://videogames.org/">Here's the earliest version in the Wayback Machine, from 1998.</a>  Eventually the webmaster grew tired of maintaining the site, developed other interests, & sold (or gave) it to someone who started to rebuild it as a general video gaming portal.  The new version was never finished, but the old museum is still up.  Instead of linking to the museum's index page, the new web master <a href="http://www.videogames.org/html/">linked to a sub-directory with the museum's contents.</a>  You can browse the site's contents directly.  Confusing, but still better than the old museum's complex framing scheme. Here's something interesting from the site: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305074333/http://www.videogames.org/html/crash.html">An article on the 1984 U.S. video game market crash which doesn't blame Atari's E.T.</a> In fact, it doesn't even mention E.T., nor does it place blame on Atari; it blames larger companies which tried to diversify into the new video game market.  It also asks if such a crash could happen again.  I think not; most new industries have a period of intense investment followed by a large correction.  A smaller video game crash could happen, but an industry-wide crash would be unusual.--><br>Bible Verse of the Day: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+147%3A4&amp;version=ESV">Psalm 147:4</a><br>Visits to WebSiteRing Today: 182; Unique: 87<br><br>

<b>1-21-17</b> <a href="http://www.stomptokyo.com/badmoviereport/">Old-Site of the Day: The Bad Movie Report</a> A B-Movie Review site, hosted by StompTokyo.  I used to like this site, but, looking it over, the webmaster used too many curse words.  He does have a nice, multipart wright up on his experiances writing & working on an 80's direct-to-video feature: <a href="http://www.stomptokyo.com/badmoviereport/making.html">Making a Bad Movie: My Personal Nightmare.</a>  Recommended reading if you dream of making a feature film.  <!--Also has a <a href="http://www.stomptokyo.com/badmoviereport/reviews/P/pokemon.html">review of Pokemon the First Movie.</a>  He liked the series, but thought the movie lacked the series' sense of fun. (That's putting it kindly.)  Actually, the first few paragraphs are a nice explanation/defence of the franchise.-->  Dr. Freex, the site's webmaster, never updated the site from a late 90's layout to a mid 2000's layout, like stomptokyo, so most of his internal links should still work.  <br>Mozilla posted a series articles examaning web freedom: <a href="https://internethealthreport.org/v01/about/calling-all-citizens-of-the-internet/">You can find a link to them on this page.</a> Here's <a href="https://internethealthreport.org/v01/digital-inclusion/">their article on web inclusiveness.</a> While I can agree that trolls can hurt the web, I've got to wonder who's a troll.  I'd much rather see community rules frankly based on a belief system instead of a blanket ban on mysterious "trolls," subject to whatever the mods believe counts as "trolling" or "hating."  Hopefully that's not too political; I don't like to write on such things. The web might become more open if ISPs still gave their customers a little bit of webspace with their accounts.  I found our old sign up paperwork a few months ago with instructions for setting up a homepage, but, when I typed in the address to do so, I found that the homepage service was long gone.  Searching for it brought up an interesting collection of orphaned Southwestern Bell pages tho.<br>Here's a Bible Verse for today: <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm">Ecclesiates 10:20, with multiple translations.</a><br>Visits to WebSiteRing Today: 191; Unique: 88<br><br>

Some tags are obselete.  This is especially true of tags made by a browser's designers instead of a standards committee. (Mozilla & Microsoft added a lot of tags in the mid-to-late 90's, xhtml was supposed to eliminate them; HTML 5 kept a few. <a href="http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/255366/why-are-the-b-and-i-tags-deprecated">There's a good wright up on it at StackOverflow.</a>)<br>Visits to WebSiteRing Today: 124; Unique: 63<br><br>

<strong>1-19-17</strong> <a href="http://www.chubba.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Chubba.com</a> Chubba is a metasearch engine made by WhatUSeek.  In the late 90's it mixed results from WhatUSeek with results from major engines; today it just offers an alternate way to search WhatUSeek & a few other web resources. I'm actually using the "site search soloution" mentioned on their main page.  It works fairly well, tho I have trouble getting it to index every page.  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990125085127/http://chubba.com/">Here's what Chubba looked like in 1999.</a> Not too different from what it looks like today, tho the color scheme & logo are different.  I love their "Unbiased Feedback," & the messages at the bottom of the page. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991013022432/http://chubba.com/feedback.html">The feedback form is very casual</a>, like WhatUSeek's old resubmission message.<br>Bible Verse of the Day: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+3%3A13-14&amp;version=ESV">Philippians 3:13-14</a><br>Visits to WebSiteRing Today: 143; Unique: 70<br><br>

<strong>1-18-17</strong> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19971211215859/http://www.atext.com/">Old-Site of the Day: atext.com in 1997</a> Now owned by a corperate texting service, but in the 90's it was owned by Architext.  Excite was made by a group of students at Stanford.  They founded a company named Architext to market their search engine.  This is their corporate site. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19980119032217/http://www.corp.excite.com/Company/lep.html">Apparently Excite's logo has a name: LEP or Little Excite Person.  Cute.</a> While we're talking about Excite, we might as well mention that they made a freeware search engine for websites: Excite for Web Servers. It's easy enough to find saved searches, but it's impossible to find a copy.  That may be for the best; it had some unpatched security holes.  Still, I'd like a copy, for historical purposes.  That, & I'd like to see how it worked.  <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/excite/AT-Internet_Grammersearch.cgi?doc=d5">Here's a saved search from Excite for Web Servers.</a>  That's not from the Wayback machine; I found it with a Google search.  Somehow it's existed hidden on someone's web server for 10+ years.  Google actually brought up several saved searches when I was trying to find a copy of Excite for Web Servers.  My guess is the program saved popular queries as regular pages for quick access.  Here's Excite's site about their freeware site search engine; archived: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961121191400/http://www.excite.com/navigate/?new">EWS entrance.</a>  Click on the low-bandwith version; the high-bandwith link's broken.

<strong>1-17-17</strong> <a href="http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/overdrawn-memory.html">Old-site of the Day: StompTokyo.com</a> I loved (& to some extent still love) this b-movie site, but it hasn't been updated in years.  Moreover, their main page no longer has a working link to their review index.  Luckily, IMDb links to a few of their old reviews.  Here's a review of Over Drawn at the Memory Bank, a  generally poorly-recieved PBS sci-fi special, which StompTokyo's reviewer loved.  This page has a working link to a list of their other reviews, which are a fun read. Note that their ratings use 1-5 lava lamps instead of 1-5 stars?

Today the directory is largely empty, and you can't find a listing on their main page; you need to know the URL, or you could follow this link: <a href="http://www.searchking.com/directory/">SearchKing Directory</a>.
