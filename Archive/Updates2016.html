<strong>12-29-16</strong> <!--<a href="http://pojo.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Pojo.com</a> I first heard of this site when browsing Bulbapedia's list of Pokemon sites.  It's a gaming portal, with a focus on collectible games.  Most of the articles appear to be fan-contributed.  Not unusual, even for an older site; most of Pokemon Village's content was contributed by fans; Super Mario HQ had several volunteer editors, and I shouldn't even have to mention GameFAQs or IMDb. Still updated; <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20040406123748/http://pojo.com">it got it's current layout in 2004.</a> I like <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030610115200/http://pojo.com/">2003's layout</a> a bit better.<br> <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20000511002136/http://pojo.com">Here's what it looked like in 2000, when it was a pure Pokemon site.</a> <br><a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/19990125091446/http://pojo.com">Before then it was a...golf site.

<strong>12-28-16</strong> <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/19970131221734/http://mckinley.com">Old-site of the Day: MicKinley.com in 1997</a> It's hard to find information on Magellan, a mid-90's search engine that was bought by Excite.  If you try to look it up on Wikipedia you're redirected to Excite's article.  Nevertheless, there is some information out there.  Here's what I've found:  Magellan was not at Magellan.com; it was at McKinley.com.  Magellan, like Excite, was designed to take queries in plain English.  It also had a directory which provided site reviews, like Excite.  The search engine did have one unique feature: you could choose to search the web, the directory, or special, editor approved family-friendly "green light" sites.  I haven't found any saved searches from this engine, so I can't say how well it worked.  The home page is cleaner than Excite's tho. Here's an article about <a href="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v/www.sfgate.com/business/amp/Excite-Will-Buy-Magellan-Search-Engine-2976079.php?amp_js_v=6#origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&exp=a4a%3A0&channelid=0&cid=1&dialog=0&prerenderSize=1&visibilityState=prerender&paddingTop=54&history=1&p2r=0&horizontalScrolling=0&csi=0&storage=1&viewerUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Famp%2Fwww.sfgate.com%2Fbusiness%2Famp%2FExcite-Will-Buy-Magellan-Search-Engine-2976079.php">Excite Buying Magellan.</a> And here's Wikipedia articles on Magellan's co-founders: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Maxwell">Christine</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Maxwell">Isabel Maxwell</a> Wikipedia's editors should really link those to Excite's page...</br>Bible Verse of the Day: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+4%3A14-15&amp;version=ESV">Proverbs 4:14-15</a><br>Visits today: 148; Unique: 57<br>

<strong>12-22-16</strong> <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/19961219002942/excite.com">Old-Site of the Day: Excite.com, in 1996</a> Excite was a search engine which used statistical data to try to match web documents to user queries, even  if the documents didn't use the exact same words as the users.  Also offered "subject grouping," which sounds like clustering, tho I haven't seen an example of it in any saved searches.  Bought several other engines, including Magellan and WebCrawler, garnered massive amounts of debt, and merged with an early broadband provider named @home before going bankrupt. You know what engine they didn't buy?  Google.  After the bankruptcy, their technology was sold to Infospace, who shelved it in favor of metasearching, and their website was sold to a lesser-known company which eventually merged with AskJeeves.  Excite also had a web directory.  Instead of just listening good sites they'd list anything and they'd give it a review. A good review was a mark of quality; the backlink was not. <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/19990903125142/http://search.excite.com:80/search.gw?search=arts">Here's an example search, for "arts," from 1999.</a> <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/19990831003911/http://search.excite.com:80/search.gw?search=computers">Here's another, for "computers," also from '99.</a> <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/19990904054900/http://search.excite.com:80/search.gw?search=Games">One more example search, about Video Games, from 1999.</a><br>Bible Verse of the Day: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+2%3A22-32&amp;version=ESV">Luke 2:22-32</a><br>

<strong>12-21-16</strong> <!--<a href="http://www.vgf.com/404.htm">Old-Site of the Day: VGF.com</a> VGF can stand for Video Gamers First, Video Games Forever, or Video Game Forums.  Currently, their main page redirects to their forums, but when exploring SMBHQ yesterday I found a link to VGF's old 404 error page, from when VGF was a gaming portal instead of a fourm. From there you can find links to other abandoned, but working, parts of the site.  That's today's link; have fun exploring the old reviews, articles, and cheat code indices.--></a><br>Bible Verse of the Day: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+1%3A1&amp;version=ESV">Psalm 1:1</A><BR>Visits to WebSiteRing Today: 115; Unique: 58<br>

<strong>12-20-16</strong> <!--<a href="http://smbhq.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Super Mario Bros. Headquarters</a> Another old favorite of mine.  This one's never been off line, as far as I know.  The web master did add some annoying in-line text adds, tho. This site isn't well organized, but you can find some cool things by searching. <a href="http://www.smbhq.com/mysteries/cases/case10.html">Here's an ancient article, debating if "Super Mario Bros: the Great Mission to Rescue Princess Peach" exists.</a> (The authors got a email asking about it; the email called it the <i>Grand</i> Mission to Rescue Princess Peach.)

Each subject appears to have had it's own domain name, probabally for SEO. <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/19991018191511/http://gamewire.net:80/">Their GameWire news site</a> has some interesting sounding articles. Sadly, they linked to an internal page which redirected users to the news articles.

Sadly, the directory links to Search.com's advanced search page instead of a list of subject-specific directories. <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20011108042823/http://www.search.com:80/top?tag=ex.se.fd.col.top">They do have a list of top searches, which is fun to browse.</a><br>Bible Verse of the Day:<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+18%3A2&amp;version=ESV"> Proverbs 18:2</a><br>Visits to WebSiteRing today: 108; Unique: 47<br>

Now, most have been replaced by large sites where fans can get all the info they need in one place.  While today's site is the oldest version Archive.org has, it's not that useful; most of the links don't work.  <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20000913125112/http://www.anipike.com/">Here's a later version of Anipike, from 2000, with working links.--></a><br>Bible Verse of the Day: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+10:1&amp;version=ESV">Proverbs 10:1<a><br>Visits to WebSiteRing today: 173; Unique: 78<br>

  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001118044000/http://www.northernlight.com/search.html"><strong>12-7-16</strong> Old-site of the day: Northernlight.com</a> Northernlight was an eary clustering search engine.  Sites were pre-sorted into catagories.  Also had exclusive articles, which users had to pay to access.  Popular with advanced searchers, it never really caught on with the public in general.  Somehow, it's survived, but it only indexes 1000 or so business news sites: <a href="https://millie.northernlight.com/dashboard.php?id=93">Northernlight Today</a><br>Here are some example searches from back-in-the-day: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001115094000/http://www.northernlight.com/nlquery.fcg?qr=movies">Northernlight Movies Search</a>  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000423225507/http://www.northernlight.com/nlquery.fcg?qr=computers">Northernlight Computers Search</a>  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001115105100/http://www.northernlight.com/nlquery.fcg?qr=programming">Northernlight Programing Search</a><br>Bible Verse for Today: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+15%3A11-32&amp;version=ESV">Luke 15:11-32</a><br>P.S.

This was back in the day when ISP's gave their users webspace with their account.  As such most sites listed don't have their own domain name; the url's look like this: <tt>http://www.someserver.net/~username/webpage.html</tt></br>Bible Verse of the day: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra+3&amp;version=ESV">Ezra Chapter 3</a></br>No Vistors Today :(</br>
  
<a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html"><strong>12-5-16</strong> Old-site of the day: "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine"</a>  Describes how Google works.  You should at least skim this.  Things I learned: Google's PageRank algorithm involves more than counting links pointing to a page; pages that are already popular (e.g. have many inbound links) carry greater weight than unpopular pages.  Also, Google has a random factor; a sort-of guess that a user may stop clicking on links and enter a new address.  This can be adjusted by IP addresses, so spammy sites can be targeted and deranked.  My explanation is rather poor; I'd reccomend reading the actual paper.  Here's another good article on PageRank: <a href="https://webworkshop.net/pagerank.html">PageRank Article from WebWorkshop.</a> The writer steps through the algorithm to show how it effects different pages' ranking. </br> Here's a Bible Verse for today: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A7&amp;version=ESV"> Matthew 7:7</a></br>Visits to WebSiteRings today: 24 Unique: 8</br>

 <a href="http://imdb.com/reviews"><strong>12-2-16</strong> Old-site of the Day: imdb.com/reviews.</a>  IMDB started off on Usenet.  They still have an archive of old usenet posts, but I cannot find a link to it on their main page.  I've provided a link to their index page, but most of the links on that page appear to be broken. <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=site:imdb.com%2Freviews">Luckily, Google has a search feature that will let users limit their search to a specific directory on a site.</a> Google may require you to enter a catchpa; don't ask me why.  I can't see a spammer trying to track a specific directory on a webserver.

 <a href="http://zerx.com/"><strong>12-1-16</strong> Old-site of the Day: Zerx.com.</a> This is an odd one.  It's a search engine that started in 1999 or 2000.  It's still alive, but has had few updates. Works fairly well for single word queries, but returns less relevant results for more specific searches. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000510201841/http://www.zerx.com/">Here's the earliest version of Zerx the Internet Archive has, from May 10, 2000.</a> Even today, it's still just "a prototype."
