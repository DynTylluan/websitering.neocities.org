Alright, here are two sites started in 1995 about castles. Going through mu backlog of old sites I found both of these today.

I can't find an archived version from before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110211034442/https://www.video-games-museum.com/">2011,</a> but even then they had a lot of systems cataloged. Apparently the english version of <a href="https://www.musee-des-jeux-video.com/">MJV,</a> a French gaming site. Anyone heard of either site before? Aha! This site seems to be connected to <a href="http://www.emu-france.com/">Emu-France,</a> which is archived as early as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020328003316/http://www.emu-france.com/">2002.</a><br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+17%3A24-27&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Matthew 17:24-27</a> 379;108</p>
<p><b>12-18-17</b> I found out yester day that CompuServe's forums closed Dec. 15, same day as AIM. For replacements CompuServe suggests <a href="https://forumania.com/">Forumania.com</a>, <a href="http://www.nlcomputerforum.nl/">NL Computer Forum</a>, and <a href="https://thelitforum.com/">The Lit Forum</a>. But you can't really replace 20+ years of history, can you? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171113232911/http://member.compuserve.com/forum_center/">Old-Site of the Day: CompuServe's Forums</a> Archived a few days before they closed. It takes about three redirects to get from the forum list to each forum, but they should be there. <a href="https://websitering.neocities.org/CompuServeCloses.txt">Here's an archived version of their closure notice, for future reference.</a><br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+24%3A12-14&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Matthew 24:12-14</a><br><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/hollywood-confronts-a-copyright-argument-potential-mass-disruption-1049516">Who owns CGI Characters?</a> "Are some of Hollywood's biggest movies from the past decade — Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Deadpool and Night at the Museum, among others — all copyright infringements because they were allegedly created with stolen technology?" Found this while browsing Compuserve's archived forums. Still current, so I'm posting it here. Basically the motion capture tech used in a lot of blockbuster films was stolen, and its owner's suing everyone for using it.<br>The FCC repealed Net Neutrality regulations last week. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/14/the-fcc-is-expected-to-repeal-its-net-neutrality-rules-today-in-a-sweeping-act-of-deregulation/?utm_term=.1aa0c66c41e5"> Here's a good article about it.</a> If you want, you can read my article from a few months ago, <a href="neutral.html">A brief History of the Net and Net Neutrality</a>. Has a prediction at the end, of what might happen if Net Neutrality was kept or repealed. Oh, and Mark Hamill and Ted Cruz got in a "Twitter Fight" about the whole thing. <a href="http://variety.com/2017/biz/news/mark-hamill-ted-cruz-twitter-ajit-pai-net-neutrality-star-wars-1202643353/">Really.</a> 843;216</p>

It started as a feature on Tomorrow's Heroes. When that site's webmaster decided to end the feature soem of its readers took it over and relaunced it as "RetroGaming Times Monthly." A few years ago they stopped publishing and merged with RetroJunk. RetroJunk never put teh site back online, so someone else restarted it as a bi-monthly publication. He even got permission to republish old issues! So, there you have it, a 20-year old gaming site that folks just won't let die. Thank goodness for that!<br><a href="https://melmagazine.com/how-brands-turned-trolling-into-a-marketing-strategy-a486654f2096">Well, this is kinda creepy...</a> 513;122</p>
