<p>Here's just a few pages about a series from my childhood, &amp; maybe yours too. I was there when the series was new, &amp; want to share how it was for those who were not.

</p><p>I wanted to have this up by 2018, for the 20th annivisiary of Pokemon's release in the U.S., but that was not to be. I had a bit of free time one night this week, so I started working. 

</p><p>There are many Pokemon sites focused on the history of the series, game mechanics, and the like. These pages are different; they're nostalgia-focused. As such they're personal; based primarely on my memories. There are too few personal sites on the web today; these few pages are meant to return to a simpler time...
