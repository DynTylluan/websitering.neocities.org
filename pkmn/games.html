<p>By today you know, or should know, that Pokemon started off as a Gameboy Game, &amp; that the anime was based on it. When Nintendo released the series in the U.S., however, they released the TV show first. Playing the game was like living the show.

</p><p>I remember getting the game for my tenth birthday, Blue Version, a gift from my grand parents. I secretly wanted Yellow, since it had Pikachu as a main character, but I was still thrilled. (Later I got a chance to play Yellow Version; it was much harder, so I was glad I got Blue.) I remember starting the game up that evening &amp; reaching the Viridian Forest, excited that I was finally going on my Pokemon adventure, just like Ash. I chose Charmander as my first Pokemon; he looked like the character from the TV show while the other starters did not. I've liked his line ever since.

</p><p>There were other games too. Pokemon pinball was popular, almost as popular as the main games. (It had better character designs than the main games, &amp; pinball's just fun.) And we can't forget about Pokemon Stadium or Pokemon Snap, both popular games whose success hasn't been repeated.
