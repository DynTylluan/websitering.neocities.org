<p>Pokemon came out right as most homes were getting access to the Internet. Naturaly, kids used their new-found voice to express their love for the series, &amp; marketers used the web to spread info about all the avaliable Pokemon merchandise. 

</p><p>But wait, how could kids make a website? HTML might be easy, but hosting is expensive. Simple: in the late 90's there were a lot of companies offering free webspace. Most, sadly, are gone, but a few, like Anglefire, still ramain. I don't know how long they'll last tho...

</p><p>I first heard of fansites in a magazine, <i>Beckett's Unofficial Pokemon Collector.</i>. They had a small section reviewing fan pages in thier second issue. Seeing that, I wanted to create a webpage myself, but our family didn't get the internet till '08 or '09. 

</p><p>Below you'll find links to old Pokemon pages, both official &amp; fan-made, some only avaliable on web archives:
