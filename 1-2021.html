They plan to sell online from now on. I wanted to show you their old website, but it looks like the earliest site at that domain name was owned by a different company. Still cool tho. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031228150001/https://www.familyvideo.com/">The video stores took over the domain by 2003.</a> Family Video was interesting because they actually owned their own buildings & rented space to other related businesses, like take out eateries. That's how they lasted so long; they weren't a video company; they were a property management company with a knack for getting related businesses together. Of course, if no one has to pay rent for months on end that business won't work. :/ <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/family-video-the-last-video-store-chain-in-the-us-is-closing-all-250-stores/ar-BB1cuSXK?ocid=uxbndlbing">Here's an article about their closure.</a> <a href="https://www.familyvideo.com/">And here's their current site, if you want to help them out by buying something.</a><br> <b>Capital Protestors</b> - Watching the news now.
