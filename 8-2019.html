Just look up your county's website; there should be a forum where you can search for tax records, get names, addresses, etc. (Note: this is from a U.S.-centric perspective.)<br><a href="http://cda.morris.umn.edu/~webbrl/YoursMineOurs/">Old-Site of the Day: The Real <i>Yours, Mine, & Ours</i> Family</a> Online since at least 2005, this page chronicals the story of the Beardsleys, who inspired the movies <i>Yours, Mine, & Ours.</i><br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+10:20&amp;version=HCSB">Bible Verse of the Day: Ecclesiastes 10:20</a>

<p><b>8-23-19</b> <a href="https://www.contemplator.com/">Old-Site of the Day: Contemplator.com</a> Lookingh up lyrics to <i>Casey Jones</i> the other day led me to <a href="https://www.contemplator.com/america/casyjones.html">this page</a>.

<p><b>8-14-19</b> <a href="Autosled.html">The Baily Autosled</a> Here's a page about the Bailey Autosled, a small roller coaster made by a Canadian company. Forgive me if it loads slowly; I added a lot of embeded videos.

<p><b>8-10-19</b> <a href="https://websitering.neocities.org/cambria.htm">Cambria Productions</a> Wikipedia's thinking about deleting their article on the folks who made Clutch Cargo, so I added a copy to my site yesterday. Finally got a chance to link it up today.

<p><b>8-7-19</b> <a href="https://www.dogsplayingpoker.org/">Old-Site of the Day: DogsPlayingPoker.org</a> You know those infamous paintings of dogs playing card games? Well, most of them were done by one man, Cassius Coolidge, & this is a fan site for him. Also includes other pieces of art with similar themes done by other artists. I actually like two of his paintings: <p><img src="cooldog.png"> <p>And: <p><img src="https://websitering.neocities.org/dog court.png"> <p>Both are slightly less anthromorphized; take the cigar out of the 1st dog's mouth & he just looks like a dog relaxing in his master's chair.

<p><b>8-2-19</b> <a href="pkmn/menu.html">The Classic Pokemon Page</a> I've wanted to do this for awhile, so here it it! A small collection of nostalgic articles, meant to look & feel like a fan site from the late 90's, the sort of thing I found interesting in highschool. Hope you enjoy it.
