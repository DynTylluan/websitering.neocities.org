GEOS was an operating system for the C64 & IBM PC. It provided a GUI, but used fewer resources than Windows. Popular with C64 users in the early 80's, but the PC version was overshadowed by Windows, primarily because Microsoft had more influence over PC maunfacturers and software developers. It was avaliable till a few years ago as low-cost OS for under-powered computers. 443;82</p>

I wonder what it used to look like & where it was... Oh! the <a href="https://nindb.net/sitefaq.html#faq1">FAQ</a> has an answer. It started on Tripod, moved to GameSpy, then moved to the new address in '09 when GameSpy stopped hosting fan sites.

<p><b>3-1-18</b> Why must the beginning of the month be so busy?<br> <a href="http://www.technofileonline.com/texts/stdoom89.html">Who Killed the Atari ST?</a> A 1989 article on Atari's computers. One of the few places I could find to confirm the ST's ability to emulate Mac and PC environments. I can't find this site in the Wayback Machine before 2006, so it's not the Old-Site of the Day, but it is interesting. Keep in mind this is a 1989 article; the author doesn't know everything which was happening with Atari, all the problems they were facing.<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020110013554/http://www.rgshoup.com:80/prof/SuperPaint/">Old-Site of the Day: rgshoup.com, in 2002</a> About SuperPaint, a computer graphics system designed by the author in the 70's while he worked for Xerox.
